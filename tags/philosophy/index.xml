&lt;p>I said in a &lt;a href="../../on-spirituality">previous post&lt;/a> that posts tagged &lt;a href="../../tags/spirituality">spirituality&lt;/a> aren&amp;rsquo;t to be interpreted as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-apt">truth-apt&lt;/a> and that I wanted to be clearer about how to interpret these posts. Well this post is an exception. &lt;em>Do&lt;/em> interpret it as making truth claims. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be more rigorous than I normally am in spiritual posts and try not to make any false claims. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="writing-meditation">Writing Meditation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This activity doesn&amp;rsquo;t require you to believe superstitions or unsubstantiated claims as a prerequisite. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. All you need is a &lt;em>pen&lt;/em> and &lt;em>paper&lt;/em>. Be sure to use a pen, not a pencil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the instructions:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Pick up the pen and hold it to the paper. Whenever you notice a thought that can be written down in words, you write it down. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about grammar or spelling, that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it&amp;rsquo;s even coherent or continuous. Don&amp;rsquo;t scratch anything out. Redundancy is perfectly fine. Just write down whatever&amp;rsquo;s on your mind. If it&amp;rsquo;s kind, peaceful, helpful, write it down. If it&amp;rsquo;s hateful, vulgar, taboo, write it down anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you don&amp;rsquo;t censor anything. Just let there be a continuous flow of thoughts from your mind to the paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Write until you notice enough thoughts that your mind outpaces your hand. Try to at least fill up 1 full page with thoughts. The more, the better. The goal is to write down as much of your own &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_talk">self-talk&lt;/a> as you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="limitations">Limitations&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This style of meditation has limitations that don&amp;rsquo;t inhibit practices like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81">Vipassana&lt;/a>. An obvious one is if your hand can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with your mind then you miss some thought-material. Another limitation is you can only capture a rather small fraction of thoughts. A significant portion of your thoughts aren&amp;rsquo;t words and sentences. They&amp;rsquo;re images, memories, abstract concepts, and emotions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of that matters for our purposes. What matters is you end up with a tangible object to reference. Please do it before you continue reading. You won&amp;rsquo;t get the full benefit otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now read the whole paper back to yourself. If you did the exercise correctly your writing will sound very unstructured. The important thing to realize is this: While you were writing your thoughts down, you were &lt;em>noticing&lt;/em> them. Otherwise how could you have written them? But in normal everyday experience, you are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> noticing them. Just because you stopped writing them down, just because you stopped &lt;em>paying attention&lt;/em> to them doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they went away. That constant flow of thought is &lt;em>still&lt;/em> there. It&amp;rsquo;s just in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="insanity">Insanity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you wrote for long enough you might notice certain things reading it back. For example you might notice you had the same thought 3 times in a row. Imagine if you were having a conversation with another person and they repeated themselves 3 times in a row. You would probably be very confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might notice in your writing things you already know. In fact &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of your thoughts might be things you already know. Imagine if you were invited into someone&amp;rsquo;s home and they started telling you what it looked like. &amp;ldquo;The walls are white. The door is made of wood. There&amp;rsquo;s a painting in the hallway&amp;rdquo;. That would be strange. But this is &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> the character of the conversation going on in your own mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re an insecure person with self-doubt then you might have written &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m useless. I can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish my goals. I should just give up&amp;rdquo;. Even the confident have insecurities. But those aren&amp;rsquo;t fruitful thoughts. If you talked to someone else that way &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re useless. You can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish your goals. You should just give up&amp;rdquo; you might catch a straight right hand to the jaw. Nevertheless you talk to yourself that way continuously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point being most of us live our lives spellbound by this endless stream of thought. Thinking thinking thinking&amp;hellip; from the moment we wake up in the morning until we close our eyes to sleep at night, from cradle to grave. We live our lives in a thought-trance with no obvious way out. You could probably stick your hand on a hot stove for 5 seconds if you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> wanted to. But even if your life depended on it you could not stop thinking even for a minute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This incessant thinking, this addiction to thought, is a form of insanity. You&amp;rsquo;ll never hear about it in the media though because an addiction that everyone suffers from is no addiction at all. It&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unawareness-of-thought-is-the-problem-not-thought-itself">Unawareness of Thought Is the Problem, Not Thought Itself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>None of this is &lt;em>new&lt;/em> information. &lt;strong>Contemplatives have said for centuries that being &amp;ldquo;hypnotized&amp;rdquo; by your own thoughts in &lt;em>every&lt;/em> moment is the normal way of being.&lt;/strong> That is to say you aren&amp;rsquo;t in the mode of noticing your thoughts most of the time. You&amp;rsquo;re simply thinking without knowing you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. Although contemplatives have talked about this mostly in religious contexts, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason you can&amp;rsquo;t recognize this fact of the mind firsthand in a secular context. That was the goal of the writing exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to clarify that thinking is an absolutely necessary faculty. It&amp;rsquo;s necessary for survival and human progress. For instance all technology first began with a thought. So thought is not the enemy here. &lt;strong>The problem is thinking without being aware of it.&lt;/strong> As contemplatives through the ages have discovered, having that background stream of thoughts is a primary source of human suffering. Reason being that internal conversation, even for the most average people, is &lt;em>often&lt;/em> negative and, as I discussed, sounds like how someone in a mental asylum might communicate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="life-is-pain">Life is Pain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There may be no more important fact to realize if you want to lead a fulfilling life than this one: Throughout the course of a normal human life, &lt;strong>the quality of one&amp;rsquo;s mind determines quality of one&amp;rsquo;s life&lt;/strong>. If you go through life entranced by your thoughts as most of us do, you will lead a life of dissatisfaction. You&amp;rsquo;ll never be fully content with the present moment. In my own experience and others', even the &lt;em>best&lt;/em> days of our lives don&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it. In ancient Indian literature, this is known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">dukkha&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-alternative-perhaps">An Alternative, Perhaps?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mystics, yogis and monks that have spent decades doing nothing but meditating in caves have suggested that there are alternatives to living entranced by your thoughts. They&amp;rsquo;ve suggested that contentment is actually a learnable skill. To most people it sounds strange that one could &lt;em>learn&lt;/em> to be content. It&amp;rsquo;s thought that contentment arises out of favorable life circumstances. This is contradicted by scientific studies showing people don&amp;rsquo;t report being much happier given increases in income once the threshold for basic needs is met.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless you believe all the contemplative literature over the millenia is &lt;em>merely&lt;/em> a product of mental illness and self-deception, you have to admit &lt;strong>some people seem to have found an alternative to being entranced by thought, to being perpetually dissatisfied with life. Once you admit that, you also have to admit that if it was possible for them, then it just might be possible for you too.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the alternatives to dissatisfaction don&amp;rsquo;t require you to ignore bad things happening in the world or accept religious dogma. They just require a shift in consciousness. For some the shift is gradual taking many years of practice. And for others like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">Eckhart Tolle&lt;/a> it&amp;rsquo;s instantaneous.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="is-spirituality-for-everyone">Is Spirituality For Everyone?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Now I&amp;rsquo;m not saying there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative for &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>. Oftentimes an interest in spirituality comes after seeing the mechanics of suffering. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to notice. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been older than age 12 when I saw it. I wanted something. I got it. I was satisfied for an instant before it wore off and I wanted something else. At that point I had the revelation that the nature of the mind is to never be satisfied. At the time, like most westerners, I made nothing of it. I assumed that was the way life was and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any other way. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I neared adulthood that I sincerely considered the possibility of alternative mind states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a basic level of introspection required to &lt;em>notice&lt;/em> the mechanics of suffering and to become suspicious of alternative ways of being. In my own experience I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how you &lt;em>couldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> notice the mechanics of suffering. To me it&amp;rsquo;s so plain and obvious I recognized it as an adolescent. But there are people that go their &lt;em>whole&lt;/em> natural lives not being the slightest bit curious about why they suffer. Some people are &lt;em>so&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;grounded&amp;rdquo; that frankly &lt;em>only&lt;/em> psychoactive substances can get them to notice that experience can be vastly different than the usual. But most people, especially westerners, prematurely assume introspection offers nothing of practical importance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="noticing-thoughts">Noticing Thoughts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if your goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to be the next Eckhart Tolle it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad idea to keep in mind what it was like to read back your own thoughts written on paper. The next time you&amp;rsquo;re sad, frustrated or depressed, just notice the mechanics of your suffering. Notice the undercurrent of thought. The paper and pen were only there to help, but you don&amp;rsquo;t need them. You can actually notice &lt;em>more&lt;/em> when you&amp;rsquo;re not limited to what you can write on paper. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not your internal dialogue that&amp;rsquo;s causing the suffering. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a bad memory. Whatever it is, try being aware of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final point I want to make is that &lt;strong>every claim I&amp;rsquo;ve made about the mind in this post can be tested in your own experience&lt;/strong>. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to take my word for it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe that unawareness of thought is a primary cause of suffering then all I can do is urge you to do is pay closer attention. It&amp;rsquo;s just a common fact of experience and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to accept any unsubstantiated claims to recognize how distracted you are all the time. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to accept unsubstantiated claims to suspect that others have found alternative ways of existing in the world and that maybe you can too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Documentary] The Norden: Prison</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/documentary-the-norden-prison/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/documentary-the-norden-prison/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-norden">The Norden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://thetvdb.com/series/the-norden">The Norden&lt;/a> is a documentary series made in 2014 first aired by Finland&amp;rsquo;s national public broadcasting company &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yle">YLE&lt;/a>. It presents the Nordic welfare model from an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective. The first episode looks at the Norwegian prison system. It captures so much of what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with &amp;ldquo;tough&amp;rdquo; prisons like those in America and most importantly it shows a better alternative. It promotes a prison model based on &lt;strong>rehabilitation, not revenge&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Prison reform is a subject I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about. It is an urgent moral necessity to address the pointless suffering that goes on in tough prisons. What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with tough prisons? Simply put, &lt;strong>tough prisons are based on falsehoods, disregard for historical data, incoherent philosophy, and confused ideas about human psychology&lt;/strong>. The term &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fractal_wrongness">fractal wrongness&lt;/a> is a perfect descriptor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In The Norden documentary, retired prison warden James Conway of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica_Correctional_Facility">Attica State Prison&lt;/a> in New York travels to 4 Nordic prisons to see how they operate. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pick on him in particular but I do want to use him as an example because he perfectly embodies everything wrong with American prisons. So for the rest of this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to take quotes from Mr. Conway in the documentary, explain what he gets wrong and why the US and other countries should immediately transition to Norwegian-style prisons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="james-conway">James Conway&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="bad-philosophy">Bad Philosophy&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;New York State and the department of correctional services are not responsible for you being an inmate. And that means &lt;strong>you put yourself here&lt;/strong>. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the department. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the staff. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame the judge. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame society. It was your actions that put yourself here&amp;hellip;A lot of folks unfamiliar with prisons think that it&amp;rsquo;s the prison&amp;rsquo;s job to make sure this person comes out as a law-abiding citizen and those of us in prison realize that&amp;rsquo;s not the case.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; James Conway&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This quote is based on bad philosophy. Specifically it&amp;rsquo;s based on the believe that people possess libertarian free will. I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked &lt;em>at length&lt;/em> about how &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">free will is incoherent&lt;/a>. For someone to have free will and be ultimately responsible for their actions would be &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning">circular&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This bad philosophy regarding free will is related to confusion about &lt;a href="../../the-self">the self&lt;/a>. For example, in a sense there&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> such a thing as a chair. There are legs, a seat and armrests and when they are put together a certain way in space and used for sitting, we call the result a &amp;ldquo;chair&amp;rdquo;. But if you only stand on it to reach high places it might be a &amp;ldquo;step stool&amp;rdquo;. Point being &amp;ldquo;chair&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stool&amp;rdquo; are mere &lt;em>nouns&lt;/em>. They aren&amp;rsquo;t the &lt;em>real&lt;/em> thing because reality isn&amp;rsquo;t words. The same is true of the nouns &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ego&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To say of inmates &amp;ldquo;It was your actions that put yourself here.&amp;rdquo; and the thinking that it&amp;rsquo;s their responsibility to change themselves is to be confused about the self. Who is the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that put yourself there and who is the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that got put there? Who is the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that is doing the changing and who is the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; that is being changed? It makes no sense. Of course people can change but there&amp;rsquo;s a contradiction in assigning ultimate blame to inmates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this whole post a lecture about free will and self. For that you can read 2 sections of my other post on free will &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-2#responsibility">responsibility&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-2#justice">justice&lt;/a>. For those of you who think I&amp;rsquo;m just &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualization">intellectualizing&lt;/a> to make excuses for inmates, I&amp;rsquo;m not. People &lt;em>should&lt;/em> admit their past mistakes. They &lt;em>should&lt;/em> make an effort to improve. They just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thought of as &lt;em>ultimately&lt;/em> responsible. Maybe there is a sense in which they are responsible, but not ultimately. Moving on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="double-standards">Double Standards&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>James Conway explains to Jarmo Haavisto, Assistant Director of Hameenlinna Prison, how cells are searched in Attica:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;I would search the bed first. Totally top to bottom it comes off and then leave that in a pile and then go around the room systematically and put everything on the bed that I&amp;rsquo;m frisking, so that when she came back in all of her property would be right here on the bed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Jarmo Haavisto:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;So you don&amp;rsquo;t put them back where they were?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s her job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Apparently the ultimate responsibility for your own actions doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to guards. According to Conway it&amp;rsquo;s okay for guards to search a cell displacing all the inmate&amp;rsquo;s belongings but then it&amp;rsquo;s the inmate&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to put all the items back. It seems self-contradictory. As a proponent of ultimate responsibility for your own actions why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be the guard&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to put all the inmate&amp;rsquo;s items back given they&amp;rsquo;re the one who displaced them? Seems like a double standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="hyperfixation-on-punishment">Hyperfixation on Punishment&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At Svartsjö minimum security prison there was an incident where an inmate didn&amp;rsquo;t consent to being on camera by putting a hood over his head.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Journalist:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;James seems a bit absentminded. He just can&amp;rsquo;t get over the incident with the inmate during our arrival.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Would this be a good time to talk about the guy with the white hood this morning?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Prison staff:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Yeah sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;We would never allow an individual to cover their face&amp;hellip;he would be called in and he would be given some kind of a sanction for that episode this morning. If he likes to walk every day, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t walk for 5 days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Journalist:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;What if it&amp;rsquo;s right to be more therapeutic? Would you have happier prisoners if you tried it you know their way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Journalist:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Why not? Why are you so sure?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>James Conway:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Our prisoners would try to manipulate the system. They misinterpret kindness for weakness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m no prison warden but I&amp;rsquo;m sure the prisoner wasn&amp;rsquo;t just &lt;em>trying&lt;/em> to make an issue. The audio in the film presents a man who just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be on camera and didn&amp;rsquo;t trust the film crew to blur out his face. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t acting violently. Yet Mr. Conway&amp;rsquo;s response to this was that the inmate shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed to go on walks for 5 days. Conway later video calls a colleague who laughs about the idea of inflicting harsh deprivation on the inmate for an extremely minor dispute. This leads us straight into the next topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="lack-of-compassion">Lack of Compassion&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The inmate has given up his right to be in society by violating the law, by violent crime, by committing murder, by committing rape. That person shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coddled, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be given a situation where we&amp;rsquo;re concerned about how they would feel if somebody was to walk by their cell and see them on the toilet. &lt;strong>Who cares how they feel.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; James Conway&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Who cares how they feel? Someone made a mistake so it&amp;rsquo;s okay to disregard their feelings? It&amp;rsquo;s okay to treat them as subhuman because they broke the law? Isolating them from society is done because it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>necessary&lt;/em> to protect society. But not giving them privacy while using the toilet? If that&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment">cruel and unusual punishment&lt;/a> then I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inmates are human beings.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what they&amp;rsquo;ve done. They deserve to be treated with dignity and respect just like everyone else. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One of the reasons we have more people in jail in the United States than any other country is &lt;a href="https://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf">we throw people in jail for things that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t justify incarceration&lt;/a> elsewhere. US prisons are filled with &lt;em>nonviolent&lt;/em> drug offenders, victims of the war on drugs which &lt;a href="../../legalize-all-drugs">should never have been waged in the first place&lt;/a>. There wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as many &lt;em>violent&lt;/em> drug offenders either if not for the war on drugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Conway doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention any of that. Like a true &lt;a href="https://www.shondaland.com/act/news-politics/a34729330/the-radical-individualism-raging-throughout-america/">radical individualist&lt;/a>, he shrugs off societal influences, such as poverty and poor education, which &lt;em>we know&lt;/em> based on evidence push people into a lives of crime. Instead he cherry picks the criminals we have the &lt;em>least&lt;/em> sympathy for. That is, murderers and rapists.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="disregard-for-evidence-dogmatism">Disregard for Evidence (Dogmatism)&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Mr. Conway claims we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t care about how inmates feel and they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coddled. But how does he know that? What logic did he use to take the step from &amp;ldquo;The inmate has given up his right to be in society by violating the law, by violent crime&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;That person shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coddled, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be given a situation where we&amp;rsquo;re concerned about how they would feel&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;? How did he go about determining that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People with Mr. Conway&amp;rsquo;s attitude would probably say it&amp;rsquo;s self-evident. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it obvious they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be treated well? After all they committed a crime. To that I would give the same general answer I give to all moral questions: &lt;a href="../../metaethics">What do you care about?&lt;/a>. I care about minimizing the number of people in prison. I care about people getting better even if that means we have to treat them better than their victims would approve of. I care about the &lt;em>evidence&lt;/em> and &lt;em>results&lt;/em> from the Nordic prison system as compared to other systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It really comes down to your values. If you value living in a society where where you don&amp;rsquo;t have millions of citizens going through the rotating door of prison, poverty and crime more than any other country, where you don&amp;rsquo;t punish and degrade people for the sake of it, where people getting better is &lt;em>more important&lt;/em> than revenge, then the best working example of that is the Nordic prison model and you should want to shift other countries closer towards it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just ask Christer Karlsson, an ex-criminal that served 27 years in a Norwegian prison:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Journalist:&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;And is that a good thing that they are soft?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Christer Karlsson:&lt;/strong> &lt;em>thinking&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Yeah. I think it&amp;rsquo;s good, to behave to treat people with human thinking. I think it&amp;rsquo;s good. Because if you are treat them badly they be badly more badly by themself. Do some more awful crime when they come out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you only value retribution, punishing people even though all the evidence shows it causes them to become more hardened criminals in the future making society &lt;em>less&lt;/em> safe with mass incarceration and recidivism paid for at the taxpayers' expense, inmates becoming more antisocial not getting the help they need just to fulfill a dogmatic fantasy based on nothing and in contradiction with our current understanding of &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">the brain&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="../../the-self">the self&lt;/a>, modern psychology &lt;em>and&lt;/em> sociology, then punishment is the way to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="red-herring">Red Herring&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When Mr. Conway saw a unit inside the maximum security Halden prison he said this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I would think the crime victims would be opposed to this type of living arrangement for the criminal.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; James Conway&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To use the same words for victims that Mr. Conway used to describe inmates: &amp;ldquo;Who cares how they feel&amp;rdquo;. I thought it was the department of correctional services, not the department of victim&amp;rsquo;s feelings. &lt;strong>We should try to cultivate compassion for those who have wronged us, not be bent on getting revenge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="budget">Budget&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;When you have an unlimited budget their models fine and it&amp;rsquo;s all wine and roses&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; James Conway&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The budget is actually be a valid concern in the small scale. American prisons are overcrowded and underfunded. The Nordics have better social services than the US and universal healthcare which means they have better resources to handle mentally ill people before they end up in prison, prison is treated more as a &lt;em>last resort&lt;/em>, they don&amp;rsquo;t lock up so many people for victimless crimes and their people are better educated giving them better opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much to be said about differences in the cultural environment between the US and the Nordics. Certainly poverty, economic inequality and mental illness needs to be taken more seriously in the US if we want to have as much success as Nordic prisons. Some people use that as an excuse for why the US can&amp;rsquo;t have Nordic prisons. I strongly disagree. America is the richest country in the history of the world. We can absolutely fix our social problems, but there needs to be the political will to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides even within the social constraints of the US both &lt;a href="https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/special-reports/2019/10/11/states-put-norway-style-prison-reforms-to-work/1682876001/">North Dakota and Oregon&lt;/a> have already started implementing the Nordic philosophy in their prisons and seen positive results and &lt;a href="https://amend.us/">Amend.us&lt;/a> is working to import the Nordic prison model into the US. &lt;strong>There&amp;rsquo;s no good excuse not to fix our broken prison system.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Change is hard&amp;rdquo; is not a good reason. Inmates are hurting and there is a moral imperative to remedy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="all-or-nothing-thinking">All or Nothing Thinking&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I think when the incident happens down the road they&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to make some changes. Everybodys not going to go along with their treatment plan that we&amp;rsquo;re doing this to help you. Somebodys gonna go against the grain. There&amp;rsquo;s always a case.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; James Conway&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course &amp;ldquo;everybody&amp;rdquo; won&amp;rsquo;t go along with the prison changes. But in Norway the recidivism rate is 20% while it&amp;rsquo;s 75% in the US. There&amp;rsquo;s several reasons that&amp;rsquo;s not a perfectly fair comparison. Some of them I mention above when I talked about &lt;a href="#budget">cultural differences&lt;/a>. But as North Dakota and Oregon have shown, it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>all&lt;/em> the fault of the social environment in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Conway is basically saying that 4 out of 20 prisoners reoffending isn&amp;rsquo;t better than 15 out of 20 because it&amp;rsquo;s not 0. His implicit message seems to be &amp;ldquo;If the Nordic system fails even for one inmate then it&amp;rsquo;ll have to revert to being a tough US prison&amp;rdquo;. Only someone who is &lt;em>obsessed&lt;/em> with punishing every slight would fail to appreciate the relative success of the Nordic system. Clearly Mr. Conway &lt;em>is&lt;/em> obsessed with punishing every slight because he thought it was appropriate to force an inmate to stay inside and not walk &lt;em>for a week&lt;/em> just because he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be on camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll end this post with a quote from Russian novelist and philosopher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

And it&amp;rsquo;s probably not the last time I&amp;rsquo;ll recommend his books. Allow me to justify why his content gets so much promotion on this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-i-promote-sam-harris-content">Why I Promote Sam Harris Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When someone holds a false belief, especially if it&amp;rsquo;s a core belief, they are likely to accept other concomitant falsehoods. This is why you don&amp;rsquo;t hear about theoretical physicist flat earthers. Being a theoretical physicist entails beliefs about the physical universe which are &lt;em>incompatible&lt;/em> with believing the earth is flat. To knowingly hold contradictory beliefs, the phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance&lt;/a>, is psychologically distressing. So people make some effort, however minimal, to reconcile their beliefs to create a consistent picture of reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The converse is also true. When someone holds true core beliefs, they&amp;rsquo;re usually right about concomitant truths as well. I&amp;rsquo;m vastly oversimplifying and I could mention many caveats but that&amp;rsquo;s generally the case. On several subject areas of my interest Sam Harris &lt;em>consistently&lt;/em> gets it right. He&amp;rsquo;s adept at navigating the pitfalls others find themselves trapped in when talking about spirituality. Sometimes I learn completely new information from him but I also find that he often expounds on my own thoughts better than I can. I hope I will eventually be as articulate on this blog as he is in his writing. Nonetheless I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with him about everything and I also don&amp;rsquo;t desire for my own voice to be identical to his.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="waking-up">Waking Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When it comes to introducing spirituality to atheists and skeptics, Waking Up is &lt;em>the&lt;/em> book to read. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it and reread it and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find &lt;em>any&lt;/em> unsupported claims. It&amp;rsquo;s expressive, relevant and intelligible to sincere truthseekers. Waking Up elaborates on the self in a clearer, more comprehensible way than &lt;a href="../../the-self">my own&lt;/a> &lt;a href="../../ego-traps">past attempts&lt;/a>. It mentions the idea of headlessness which &lt;a href="../../the-eternal-here-and-now">I&amp;rsquo;ve also talked about before&lt;/a>. So before you read anything from other popular spiritual authors, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading Waking Up first. It gives the broader context that other books on spirituality leave out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waking Up is a refreshing, rational middleground on spirituality avoiding both &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Spirituality">denial of spiritual experiences&lt;/a> by skeptics &lt;em>and&lt;/em> mystical &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Woo">woo-woo&lt;/a> peddled by &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra">Deepak Chopra&lt;/a> and other pseudointellectuals. I recommend it to anyone remotely interested in spirituality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To finish off this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with a quote from the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Until we can talk about spirituality in rational terms—acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence—our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. This book has been my attempt to begin such a conversation.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The fundamental &lt;em>game&lt;/em> of being is like the game of hide and go seek. We hide in the thoughts we don&amp;rsquo;t know we&amp;rsquo;re having. They become who we are. Then one day, something or someone wakes us up and we realize we were playing a game the entire time. This could take 10 seconds or 10 years depending on the person. But, the game goes on several times in a single human life, played out in a different way each time. Just imagine all the ways the game is being played across all of humanity. The game of being a good person and not an evil one. The game of seeking happiness. The game of seeking enlightenment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Me in &lt;a href="../../ego-traps">Ego Traps&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of you just read that thinking something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;What on earth is he talking about? He&amp;rsquo;s gone off the deep end&amp;rdquo;. Skeptics would say I&amp;rsquo;m peddling &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra">Deepak Chopra&lt;/a> level &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Woo">woo-woo&lt;/a>. And I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them for thinking that. Take the first sentence &amp;ldquo;The fundamental &lt;em>game&lt;/em> of being is like the game of hide and go seek&amp;rdquo;. If you read that as a literal statement, it&amp;rsquo;s unfalsifiable at best and meaningless at worst. The rest of that paragraph and parts of other posts tagged &amp;ldquo;spirituality&amp;rdquo; have the same problem. For that, I apologize. I never meant to peddle woo-woo. I am &lt;em>definitely&lt;/em> no Deepak Chopra and I have no intentions of promoting pseudoscience or irrational thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure how I wanted those posts to be interpreted. I was unsure of my &lt;em>writing&lt;/em> because I was unsure of my &lt;em>thinking&lt;/em>. You can see that in my protracted preface to &lt;a href="../../doublethink">Doublethink&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As a quick note, what people post online is often taken as something they will forever agree with and are forever held to. This is unreasonable. There needs to be some equivalent of forgiveness if one posts something horrible online, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying people aren&amp;rsquo;t responsible for what they post. But I am saying we should aspire to take the most charitable interpretation of what people post if we care about advancing the conversation. Obviously a person&amp;rsquo;s character is a factor in how you interpret what they post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my blog, I want to retain the right to post not only ideas that I understand well. But I also want the freedom to talk about things I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about. That means I run the risk of being wrong. No one posting their ideas online openly should expect to be immune to criticism. Criticism comes with the territory. But I want to say I&amp;rsquo;m interested in sharing ideas. If it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me you&amp;rsquo;re only interested in taking my words out of context, twisting what I write or using cheap gotcha&amp;rsquo;s because I didn&amp;rsquo;t state something perfectly, then I probably won&amp;rsquo;t respond. If you want clarification about anything I discuss, visit my &lt;a href="../../about">about page&lt;/a> for contact details. With that cleared up, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the meat of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Me in &lt;a href="../../doublethink">Doublethink&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anyone who has tried to express spiritual experiences and concepts can attest to the difficulty of conveying them to others without sounding like a &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quackery">quack&lt;/a>. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good remedy for that. What I do have is an explanation for &lt;em>why&lt;/em> it&amp;rsquo;s so difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-talking-about-spirituality-is-hard">Why Talking About Spirituality is Hard&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason talking about spirituality is hard. It&amp;rsquo;s because words never do justice to spiritual experience. Nothing I can say in the English language, or any other language, can convey the &lt;em>gravity&lt;/em> of a truly spiritual experience. Spiritual orators therefore appropriately resort to analogy, myth and storytelling to allude to their spiritual experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="spirituality-and-skeptics">Spirituality and Skeptics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The problem skeptics readily point out is most spiritual orators are all too sympathetic to pseudoscience, religion and woo-woo. This leads them to conclude that spiritual experiences are just forms of mental illness and irrationality. What they don&amp;rsquo;t realize is spiritual orators gravitate to pseudoscience, religion and woo-woo precisely because &lt;em>&lt;strong>skeptics fail to connect to the character of spiritual experiences&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. That is to say if I want to talk about spirituality I have a much better chance at effectively imparting my experiences to a priest than a skeptic. To quote Sam Harris' blog post &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/whats-the-point-of-transcendence/">What&amp;rsquo;s the Point of Transcendence?&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;experiences of self-transcendence are generally only sought and interpreted in a religious or “spiritual” context—and these are precisely the phenomena that tend to increase a person’s faith. How many Christians, having felt self-transcending love for their neighbors in church or body-dissolving bliss in prayer, decide to ditch Christianity? Not many, I would guess. How many people who never have experiences of this kind (no matter how hard they try) become atheists? I don’t know, but there is no question that these states of mind act as a kind of filter: they get counted in support of ancient dogma by the faithful; and their absence seems to give my fellow atheists yet another reason to reject religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading the comments on Jerry’s blog exposes the problem in full. There are several people there who have absolutely no idea what I’m talking about—and they take this to mean that I am not making sense. Of course, religious people often present the opposite problem: they tend to think they know exactly what I’m talking about, in so far as it can seem to support one religious doctrine or another. Both these orientations present impressive obstacles to understanding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Harris has even had to &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/a-plea-for-spirituality/">defend his use of the word spiritual&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/on-spiritual-truths/">argue that spiritual experiences actually happen&lt;/a>. Us spiritual skeptics have always been on the defense of spirituality against skeptics that seem to have never had a spiritual experience in their life. Or if they have had such an experience they somehow failed to see &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/whats-the-point-of-transcendence/">the significance of it&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="going-forwarda-namegoing_forwarda">Going Forward&lt;a name="Going_Forward">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> want to always be playing defense when sharing spiritual ideas. But I &lt;em>do&lt;/em> want to avoid making unsubstantiated and vague claims about the nature of experience. So from this point forward posts tagged &amp;ldquo;spirituality&amp;rdquo; are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to be interpreted as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-apt">truth-apt&lt;/a>, even in the limited context of subjective experience. In other words I&amp;rsquo;m not making &lt;em>any&lt;/em> truth claims. But I also want to clarify that I&amp;rsquo;m not writing &lt;em>mere&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;poetry&amp;rdquo; either. What I am trying to do is offer a body of text, which is artistic in nature, that &lt;em>corresponds&lt;/em> to a real subjective experience had by myself or someone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you read &lt;a href="https://headless.org/experiments/">the experiments on headless.org&lt;/a> that I have referred to in the past, my spiritual writing going forward will be &lt;em>similar&lt;/em> to that writing style. It&amp;rsquo;s the same sort of writing. However the reason I want to avoid making truth-apt claims is that we all have &lt;em>different&lt;/em> subjective experiences. &lt;em>&lt;strong>The final authority on your experience is you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> If your subjective experience contradicts my writing, your subjective experience should take precedence. My inner world is almost certainly different than yours and I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to impose by saying you &lt;em>must&lt;/em> relate to a specific myth or &lt;a href="https://headless.org/poetry-home.htm">poem&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://headless.org/experiments">experiment&lt;/a> that I find compelling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I share that myth or poem or experiment is because &lt;em>I&lt;/em> found it compelling or at least I saw how others &lt;em>could&lt;/em> find it compelling in their spiritual journey. Your experience may be completely different and that&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fine. It&amp;rsquo;s to be expected because we&amp;rsquo;re dealing in &lt;em>subjectivity&lt;/em>, not &lt;em>objectivity&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for my past posts on spirituality, you should interpret them in the same way. Think of my spiritual posts as doors to experiences. Some doors are locked. You&amp;rsquo;re forever barred from what lies behind them. Those experiences are simply not in the cards for you. Other doors require a key. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to find out what&amp;rsquo;s behind those doors, but it takes some effort. Other doors are missing doorknobs. They might already be cracked open or you might open them by accident. It&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine to be drawn toward certain doors and not others. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t make missteps on your spiritual journey. It just means my journey isn&amp;rsquo;t identical to yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, read the spiritual texts you find most compelling by all means but give your own conscious experience precendence over &lt;em>any&lt;/em> text. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to make objective truth claims about reality or present a theory in the typical sense of the word. My spiritual writing is expressly written with the hope that you relate to it in your inner world or are entertained by it. In the best case it even helps to further your spiritual life journey. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do with these posts. Nothing more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll link to this section in future spirituality posts where it&amp;rsquo;s applicable so there&amp;rsquo;s no confusion on how to interpret my writing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Video] Atheist Debates - Argument From Design, Part 1: Order and Purpose</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/video-atheist-debates-argument-from-design-part-1-order-and-purpose/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/video-atheist-debates-argument-from-design-part-1-order-and-purpose/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillahunty">Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a> refutes the argument that a god must exist because the universe requires a designer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Death has been an ever-present fact of life since the dawn of humanity. Large parts of human culture have been shaped by the knowledge that one day we will cease to be. In the past our species has had no choice but to come to terms with it. But technological progress is now accelerating so rapidly that a cure for aging is &lt;em>conceivable&lt;/em>. Some even argue it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>inevitable&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of curing death makes many of us uncomfortable, at least initially. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a society where aging and death no longer pose a threat. So much about our culture would have to change. And yet &lt;a href="https://nickbostrom.com">Nick Bostrom&lt;/a> argues not only is curing death preferable, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>moral imperative&lt;/em> we should strive to achieve as soon as possible. He goes so far as to argue that &amp;ldquo;deathist&amp;rdquo; ideologies, ideologies that endorse or encourage complacency with death as a part of life, while useful in the past for consoling people, today pose &amp;ldquo;fatal barriers to urgently needed action&amp;rdquo;. Anyone with an interest in philosophy should read his fable about death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Link below]&lt;br>
&lt;a href="https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html">The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="morality">Morality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My own view of death is informed by &lt;a href="../../metaethics">how I see morality&lt;/a>. To give you a taste of it, I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying this: &lt;strong>Your intrinsic values can never be wrong&lt;/strong>. Another way of expressing that is: &lt;em>If&lt;/em> there are things you value above everything else, those things &lt;em>cannot&lt;/em> be mistaken. They may be highly abstract. They may not fit into words. They may even change over time. But it&amp;rsquo;s incoherent to say you are wrong about your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_%28ethics%29">intrinsic values&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reference to what can your intrinsic values be said to be wrong? For example if you value happiness above all else and you think money (the things you can do with it) makes you happy, money is an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_value">instrumental value&lt;/a>. You value money &lt;em>because&lt;/em> you value happiness. If you hit the lottery tomorrow and you&amp;rsquo;re no happier than before, then perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re wrong to value money. But you &lt;em>can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> be wrong to value happiness. If it ever seems that you are that just means happiness isn&amp;rsquo;t an &lt;em>intrinsic&lt;/em> value for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if someone asked me &amp;ldquo;Should we cure death?&amp;rdquo;, my response would be &amp;ldquo;Well what do you value?&amp;rdquo;. If your eventual demise is one of your &lt;em>intrinsic&lt;/em> values then I can&amp;rsquo;t really tell you you&amp;rsquo;re wrong to value death. I can, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a rational agent, it won&amp;rsquo;t convince you. What Bostrom is saying in his fable to &amp;ldquo;deathists&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;You only &lt;em>think&lt;/em> you value death. You don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> want to die&amp;rdquo;. The purpose of his fable is to correct your intuition about death. It&amp;rsquo;s the same as my earlier example where you value money because you value happiness, but then hitting the lottery corrects the intuition that money brings happiness. Bostrom is saying, like money, you only think you value death, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sums up my perspective on his fable. After reading his fable and his argument I&amp;rsquo;m more sympathetic than before to the cause of curing death. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;s right that most of us won&amp;rsquo;t realize how much we actually value a cure for aging and death until we&amp;rsquo;re already on the brink of a cure. And by that point we will wish we prioritized a cure much sooner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Podcast] The Key to Trump's Appeal</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/podcast-the-key-to-trumps-appeal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/podcast-the-key-to-trumps-appeal/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many things I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with but I understand the motivation behind them. Religion is an example. I am not a religious person, but I can easily see the &lt;em>appeal&lt;/em> of religion. Religion offers consolation for death anxiety. People need to feel like their lives have meaning. Religion offers purpose. People want to believe there&amp;rsquo;s something more to life than everyday conscious experience because frankly, for lots of people, everyday experience just isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough. Everyday experience is dissatisfaction, disappointment and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">dukkha&lt;/a>. People need hope that &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t all there is. Religion gives people that hope. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re nonreligious, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see &lt;em>why&lt;/em> religion appeals to people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s appeal to half of Americans on the other hand is something that has puzzled me for years. It&amp;rsquo;s not that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to &lt;em>me&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to comprehend how he appeals to &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em>, especially such a large fraction of American voters. I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in the confusion. &lt;a href="https://samharris.org">Sam Harris&lt;/a> has also admitted to struggling to understand Trump&amp;rsquo;s appeal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made many inquiries to Trump supporters about what they find appealing about him. I get a wide variety of answers but none of the answers given, even taken altogether, seem to account for his appeal. Conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve had with Trump supporters have made me disinclined to take their word for why they support him. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how one such conversation typically goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;What makes Trump appeal to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;He wants to build a wall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;If he didn&amp;rsquo;t would you still vote for him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;So the wall isn&amp;rsquo;t the reason he appeals to you. At least it&amp;rsquo;s not the only reason. What else makes Trump appeal to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;He tells the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s concrete examples of him contradicting himself.&amp;rdquo; (I show examples)&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;So? All politicians lie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;So truthtelling isn&amp;rsquo;t the real reason he appeals to you either. What&amp;rsquo;s his strongest appeal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;He runs the country like a business. He&amp;rsquo;s a businessman, not a politician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;But he routinely blames everyone else for &lt;em>his&lt;/em> failures. In a business setting, doing that gets you fired. So he&amp;rsquo;s not running the country like a business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Myself&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;What if he kicked a baby?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Trump Supporter&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and so on and so forth. So you can see the reason I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to take Trump supporters at their word on why Trump is appealing. Even when I remove their stated reasons for supporting him it makes zero difference. They still find him appealing. I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re purposely misdirecting me or being deceptive. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear there&amp;rsquo;s something else going on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Studies in the field of psychology have shown that the color of the walls in a room, the temperature of a coffee offered to test subjects, and the wording of a question can all influence the outcome of an experiment. But the test subjects &lt;em>never&lt;/em> cite those things as significant factors in their decision making despite the statistics indicating they &lt;em>were&lt;/em> significant influences. The same sort of phenomenon is occurring when Trump supporters explain why Trump is appealing. The reasons they give are reasons they &lt;em>believe&lt;/em> they find him appealing, but not the &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> reasons. There are underlying psychological influences at play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sam Harris has a fascinating take on Trump&amp;rsquo;s appeal which suggests what one of those underlying psychological influences might be. I&amp;rsquo;ll let him do &lt;a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=j3xBUNIkA_c&amp;amp;dark_mode=true&amp;amp;autoplay=1">the talking&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anyone else speak with the same clarity and completeness about Trump as Harris, so that&amp;rsquo;s why I picked these clips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a very similar if not the same opinion of Trump 4 years ago. I immediately recognized him as a narcissistic unintelligent con man unfit for public office. If I had expressed my opinion at the time in writing it probably would have sounded much like these clips from the Making Sense podcast. Although much has happened since 2016, I still find these clips worth sharing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The word &amp;ldquo;sports&amp;rdquo; covers a wide variety of activities. It&amp;rsquo;s so broad that its usefulness as a word is limited. What can you say about sports? &amp;ldquo;I like/dislike sports. I play/don&amp;rsquo;t play sports&amp;rdquo;. If you talk about &amp;ldquo;popular sports&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contact sports&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;mind sports&amp;rdquo;, there&amp;rsquo;s so much more you can say than if you&amp;rsquo;re just talking about &amp;ldquo;sports&amp;rdquo;. And if you pick a particular sport like basketball then you open up a world of things you can talk about. You can talk about rules of the game, the history, famous players/teams, statistics, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the same way, you can talk about &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; in a general sense. But when you&amp;rsquo;re just talking about intelligence, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say much. So instead, to make it more interesting, you can differentiate between mathematical intelligence, social intelligence, historical intelligence, philosophical intelligence, etc. For many people, talking about intelligence in a linear or binary way doesn&amp;rsquo;t accurately describe their situation. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few case studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="case-study-1-kim-peek">Case Study #1: Kim Peek&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek">Laurence Kim Peek&lt;/a> is the perfect example of the abstraction of general intelligence breaking down. Kim is the inspiration for the movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/">Rain Man&lt;/a>. According to Kim&amp;rsquo;s father Francis, Kim learned to read before age 2. Kim read the left page with his left eye and right page with his right eye. He was able to read 1 page per second remembering nearly all of it years later. He was a human encyclopedia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kim also didn&amp;rsquo;t learn to walk until age 4. He was diagnosed severely mentally retarded and had an 87 IQ. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t button up his shirt and had great difficulty socializing and performing basic motor tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one way, Kim was superhuman. In another way, he was cognitively limited. He possessed a skill to a degree that no one else on the planet was known to have it. He also had limitations associated with being severely mentally retarded. He&amp;rsquo;s no genius, but he&amp;rsquo;s no idiot. He&amp;rsquo;s not really of average intelligence either. And so here you can see the word &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; breaks down. It fails to meaningfully describe Kim. For describing Kim Peek, it&amp;rsquo;s more useful to talk about &amp;ldquo;types of intelligence&amp;rdquo;, not just generalized intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="case-study-2-daniel-tammet">Case Study #2: Daniel Tammet&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For the second case study, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tammet">Daniel Tammet&lt;/a>. He is an &lt;a href="https://autism.wikia.org/wiki/Autistic_savant">autistic savant&lt;/a>. Daniel set the European record reciting pi to 22,514 digits without a single mistake. He knows 10 languages and is able to become conversational in new languages in only a week. Daniel is able to perform huge math calculations in his head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the most unique thing about Daniel is that he has subjective insight on how he can perform huge mental calculations. In our first case study with Kim Peek, Kim could not articulate how he remembered everything. Most savants can&amp;rsquo;t articulate their abilities, but Daniel can. He wrote an entire book on it called &lt;a href="http://www.danieltammet.net/numbers.php">Thinking in Numbers&lt;/a>. In his own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;When I multiply numbers together, I see two shapes. The image starts to change and evolve, and a third shape emerges. That&amp;rsquo;s the answer. It&amp;rsquo;s mental imagery. It&amp;rsquo;s like maths without having to think.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The fact that he is able to introspect on his own savant capabilities is extraordinarily unique and worthy of recognition in and of itself. He also happens to share my feeling about intelligence:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I know from my own experience that there is much more to &amp;lsquo;intelligence&amp;rsquo; than an IQ number. In fact, I hesitate to believe that any system could really reflect the complexity and uniqueness of one person&amp;rsquo;s mind, or meaningfully describe the nature of his or her potential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Daniel has no apparent mental disability. But he can&amp;rsquo;t leave his house without counting the number of clothes he&amp;rsquo;s wearing. He can&amp;rsquo;t drive. He has a hard time at the beach because of all the grains of sand. Socializing takes much more mental effort for him than it does for a neurotypical person because he has autism. He&amp;rsquo;s so high-functioning that his mental disability is more or less invisible, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make his struggles any less real.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="autism-and-savantism">Autism and Savantism&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Less than 1% of the neurotypical population has &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome">savant syndrome&lt;/a> while &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677584/">that number is up to 1 in 10 with autistic individuals&lt;/a>. About half of savants are autistic while the other half have some other developmental disorder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Autism doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee you to be intelligent at something else as a trade-off for social intelligence. Instead, you have up to a 10% chance of being a savant if you&amp;rsquo;re autistic. It also isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily true that autism &lt;em>causes&lt;/em> savantism. But it&amp;rsquo;s clear from the statistics that autism &lt;em>goes with&lt;/em> savantism more than neurotypicality goes with savantism. Savantism seem to defy the conventional notion that intelligence is linear and genius is on one end with mental deficiency on the other. It seems to suggest that treating intelligence as linear is an oversimplification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="social-consequences">Social Consequences&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although savantism is a fun research topic, there are interesting social consequences of the nonlinearity of intelligence that have nothing to do with savantism or extraordinary mental ability. I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example of nonlinear intelligence in the context of free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="free-software">Free Software&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There were so many conversations I had about &lt;a href="https://www.fsf.org/philosophy">free software&lt;/a> during my time as a student. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, free software is software that respects the user&amp;rsquo;s freedom. It&amp;rsquo;s more ethical than &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/">non-free software&lt;/a>. What I came to realize through those conversations is that technological prowess and moral wisdom are two completely separate types of intelligence. But before I explain how I came to realize that, I need to make an important distinction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are those that understand something has negative effects yet do it anyway and those that don&amp;rsquo;t understand the negative effects. There are more people that believe in being vegan than there are actual vegans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Likewise, there are more software engineers that believe in free software than software engineers that write free software. When I distinguish the type of intelligence that is &amp;ldquo;technological prowess&amp;rdquo; from the type of intelligence that is &amp;ldquo;moral wisdom&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about skilled software engineers who don&amp;rsquo;t understand the harm of writing non-free software, especially if it has been explained to them before how harmful non-free software is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were some students and professors I talked to that fell into that category of possessing the technical prowess to write software while lacking the moral wisdom to see the importance of free software. They were great at programming, but did not understand the social consequences of writing proprietary software even after I explained it and provided several online resources. This is not to say they&amp;rsquo;ll never understand. But the point is I understood why free software is important and how non-free software harms society after watching &lt;a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">Richard Stallman&amp;rsquo;s TED talk&lt;/a> once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t share that to gloat, but to make a point. It was hard for me to understand how others, especially professors far more knowledgeable about software than I am, could not grasp the social necessity of free software instantly upon hearing a single TED talk even with their sincere effort. Eventually, I realized that technological prowess and moral wisdom are two completely separate types of intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="moral-wisdom-as-intelligence">Moral Wisdom as Intelligence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some readers are going to disagree with me referring to &amp;ldquo;moral wisdom&amp;rdquo; as a form of intelligence. After all, being a good person and being intelligent are two separate things, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I agree, but &lt;em>knowing&lt;/em> which actions and policies lead to a better society isn&amp;rsquo;t a matter of being a good person. It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of possessing a certain kind of intelligence that I call &amp;ldquo;moral wisdom&amp;rdquo;. History has shown the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades">worst&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">atrocities&lt;/a> were carried out by people who thought they were doing good, usually perverted by religious ideology. When I talk about moral wisdom, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean doing the right thing. I mean having the intelligence to know what the right thing is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When people have technological prowess without moral wisdom, we end up with the negative social consequence of having people with the kind of intelligence necessary to engineer proprietary software but lacking the kind of intelligence necessary to see that they&amp;rsquo;re perpetuating an unjust social system. It would be better if those people had never learned to program in the first place because their work will only subjugate people. Most software engineers don&amp;rsquo;t become software engineers to think about ethics, so there are lots of software engineers out there engineering evil software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, software engineering isn&amp;rsquo;t even the only endeavor that negatively affects society when people have asymmetric intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="socially-harmful-combinations-of-intelligence">Socially Harmful Combinations of Intelligence&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some more examples are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are people with the kind of intelligence necessary to fly planes into towers but lacking the kind of intelligence necessary to see past the religious myth motivating them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are people with the kind of intelligence necessary to build mass surveillance systems but lacking the kind of intelligence necessary to see how incompatible those systems are with a free society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are people with the kind of intelligence necessary to acquire political power but lacking the kind of intelligence necessary to make good, evidence-based policy decisions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are people with the kind of intelligence necessary to see the importance of voting but lacking the kind of intelligence necessary to pick a good candidate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not saying all these instances are &lt;em>only&lt;/em> related to intelligence. Sometimes people &lt;em>are&lt;/em> just malicious or selfish. But lacking certain kinds of intelligence often has far more to do with apparently malicious behavior than is admitted. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to just say someone is a &amp;ldquo;bad person&amp;rdquo; than to consider their intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, the terrorists that flew the planes into the twin towers on 9/11 were &lt;a href="https://thereligionofpeace.com/">motivated by an ideology&lt;/a>. If they had the kind of intelligence related to critical thinking and questioning core beliefs, they may have found out that Islam is a fairytale and never would have carried out the attacks. Believing baseless ideologies is related to critical thinking which is a kind of intelligence. You can blame it on society for never explicitly applying critical thinking to religion, but critical thinking skills are still a form of intelligence regardless of the reason a person may lack them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intelligence-is-dynamic">Intelligence is Dynamic&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="learning">Learning&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The last point I want to make is that intelligence is it&amp;rsquo;s highly dynamic. The human brain is capable of creating new patterns of behavior and thought to become better at a skill. Once you learn to ride a bike, that muscle memory stays with you. You don&amp;rsquo;t forget how to do it unless you have some traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other types of intelligence that do require constant reinforcement. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen&lt;/a>, the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest chess player, could not quit chess for 5 years, come back, and still expect to be the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest chess player. Brain research suggests that the brain is a &amp;ldquo;use it or lose it&amp;rdquo; organ. You either keep learning or you lose your ability to learn. The brain needs to learn new things to remain plastic and healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The takeaway here is that brains are extremely dynamic systems. If you&amp;rsquo;re missing a certain kind of intelligence, you &lt;em>can&lt;/em> learn it. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the most freeing things to learn about yourself. You might never be as intelligent at chess as Magnus Carlsen, but you can improve. You&amp;rsquo;re not confined to things you already know.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="environmental-factors">Environmental Factors&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Intelligence is not only dynamic because you can learn. Intelligence and learning are both dynamic because they&amp;rsquo;re affected by other factors such as your mood, the amount of rest you get, your diet and environmental influences. One of the most important factors for learning is an environment where you feel comfortable making mistakes. Being in an environment where your mistakes are mocked kills motivation to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there&amp;rsquo;s a professor that mocks a student for asking basic questions, that student will eventually become demotivated and stop asking. They&amp;rsquo;ll accept their ignorance on the subject because nobody likes being put down. Put that student in a different classroom where they feel they can be open about their ignorance and won&amp;rsquo;t be judged or mocked and they might excel beyond what others originally thought them capable of.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="be-open-minded-about-intelligence">Be Open-Minded About Intelligence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What I want to promote is a sense of open-mindedness about human intelligence. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get frustrated when someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand something that comes easily to you. That&amp;rsquo;s the natural thing to do. But perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re the wrong person to explain it or the way you explain it is confusing to them. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right time, environment, or circumstances for them to learn. Everyone has different intelligences and different capacities for acquiring intelligences. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s really important to have patience with others. I don&amp;rsquo;t just say that to be politically correct either. &lt;strong>To call anyone generally intelligent or unintelligent is almost always an oversimplification of intelligence and human potential&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intelligence is not binary nor linear nor static. It&amp;rsquo;s a multidimensional, highly dynamic human capacity. We should consider that before putting labels on people. I&amp;rsquo;ll end with a quote from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye">Bill Nye&lt;/a>, the science guy:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pledge of Allegiance</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-pledge-of-allegiance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-pledge-of-allegiance/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-pledge">The Pledge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many foreigners would be surprised to find out that we have something in the US called the Pledge of Allegiance. It&amp;rsquo;s recited in public schools across the whole country every day with students standing facing the flag hand over heart. It goes like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To foreigners, the idea of all students standing up every morning chanting this probably sounds creepy. But since Americans are indoctrinated into chanting it starting in primary school, it goes unquestioned. Most American students don&amp;rsquo;t ever think about what the words mean. It&amp;rsquo;s just a ritual. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it, but I&amp;rsquo;m just giving rationale for why students go along with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="legality">Legality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>American students aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>legally&lt;/em> required to stand for the Pledge. In &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/624/case.html">West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&lt;/a>, the Supreme Court ruled that students can&amp;rsquo;t be compelled to stand for or recite the Pledge as that would constitute compulsory speech, violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. Also students can&amp;rsquo;t be required to justify themselves for not standing. So it is well within your rights not to stand as an American student.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might still be &lt;em>socially expected&lt;/em> to stand depending on where you live. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that most other students stand, so you&amp;rsquo;ll feel uncomfortable the first few times if you choose to sit it out. With time it does get easier to stay sitting though. It&amp;rsquo;s only a few seconds of resisting peer pressure anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-of-the-pledge">Content of The Pledge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break down what the pledge actually says. For starters, &amp;ldquo;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. It seems strange to pledge allegiance to a flag. A flag is a piece of fabric. What does it even mean to pledge your allegiance to a piece of fabric? Try figuring that one out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most controversial part of the pledge: &amp;ldquo;one nation under God&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;under God&amp;rdquo; part was added in 1954 during the Cold War emphasizing the differences between the US and Soviet Union. Since then, monotheistic religion has been endorsed in public school through the Pledge. What happened to separation of church and state? There have been efforts by secular groups to challenge this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;indivisible&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear in which sense we are supposed to be indivisible. We are more politically divided than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;with liberty and justice for all&amp;rdquo;. This is a nice thought. But it&amp;rsquo;s just not true. Our nation doesn&amp;rsquo;t have liberty and justice for all. We&amp;rsquo;ve certainly made progress, but still roughly half a million Americans not convicted of a crime are behind bars right now. Is that liberty and justice for all? What about the 1% of our population in prison being deprived of basic human dignity as you read this. Where is their justice? The Pledge says liberty and justice for &lt;em>all&lt;/em>, not liberty and justice for only model citizens. I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a very high standard to meet, but we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pretend we&amp;rsquo;re there yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clearly the content of the Pledge has quite a few big problems. The only part I don&amp;rsquo;t take issue with is the part about the US being a republic. Everything else could be improved upon. I would avoid standing for the Pledge on the basis of its content alone. But there&amp;rsquo;s an even better reason not to stand for the Pledge, even if the problems with the content of the Pledge are resolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pledge-is-a-form-of-brainwashing">The Pledge is a Form of Brainwashing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When do Americans first learn the Pledge? Not as preteens or teenagers. We learn it from the first day of public school when we are too young to understand the meaning. We are too young to question it, to decide if we should be doing it or not. It&amp;rsquo;s not really presented to us as optional, even though legally it is. It&amp;rsquo;s just something we are all commanded to do. Truth be told, most teachers probably aren&amp;rsquo;t aware that it&amp;rsquo;s optional either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thought of a room full of students all standing facing the flag hand over heart chanting allegiance without thinking about it evokes a very uncomfortable feeling. It communicates a certain message even if you don&amp;rsquo;t say the actual words. It&amp;rsquo;s saying &amp;ldquo;You &lt;em>must&lt;/em> love this country! You &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be a sincere patriot!&amp;rdquo;. Any practice that tries to mandate how you feel is repulsive. It leaves students that don&amp;rsquo;t love their country feeling guilty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t love your country. Are you a terrible citizen because love isn&amp;rsquo;t what you feel? There&amp;rsquo;s this idea among many Americans that they love their country and others &lt;em>ought&lt;/em> to as well. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. Patriotism is involuntary. It can&amp;rsquo;t be forced. Maybe you can be coerced or peer pressured into putting your hand over your heart and looking solemn, but that&amp;rsquo;s not real devotion to your country. It&amp;rsquo;s an empty gesture.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-network-effect">The Network Effect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re an American student, you accomplish 2 important things by not standing for the morning brainwashing session:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You cause other students to think critically. Other students will notice you are not standing. This causes them to reflect on their standing which they previously never thought about. They might ask you why you don&amp;rsquo;t stand. That gives you the opportunity to explain the problems with the content of the Pledge and how it&amp;rsquo;s actually a form of brainwashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You make it easier for other students not to stand. If others decide to join you in sitting it out, they won&amp;rsquo;t feel alone in doing so. The more people that sit it out, the more standing students will feel the need to think critically about why they&amp;rsquo;re standing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="my-story">My Story&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I stopped standing for the Pledge in high school (secondary for international readers). As a nonbeliever, I took issue with the phrase &amp;ldquo;under god&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most eventful thing to come of my sitting was a teacher confronted me over it before class in front of all the other students. He told me I have to stand and he asked me why I didn&amp;rsquo;t stand. I went to a conservative high school and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make an issue since I was surrounded by a class full of students that likely thought the same as he did. If I did say something, students likely would have chimed in to tell me why I was wrong. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be shamed by the moral majority, so I just said I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In retrospect, I should have spoken up about why I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to sit even if I got shamed. It&amp;rsquo;s important for one&amp;rsquo;s voice to be heard, even if the message is unpopular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, I would have been satisfied with the Pledge if &amp;ldquo;under god&amp;rdquo; was removed. Since then, as you can see in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve found many more objections to it besides violating church state separation. Now I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t support any pledge in public schools, regardless of its content especially if it&amp;rsquo;s performed before students reach the age of reason, it isn&amp;rsquo;t critically examined beforehand, and students aren&amp;rsquo;t explicitly told they don&amp;rsquo;t have to participate. Even then, teachers could still be biased against students that refuse to do it. And students that don&amp;rsquo;t might get bullied for it in conservative schools. It goes against the spirit of education, so better to just abolish it entirely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing Civility to Public Discourse With the Steel Man Technique</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/bringing-civility-to-public-discourse-with-the-steel-man-technique/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/bringing-civility-to-public-discourse-with-the-steel-man-technique/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-united-states-in-2020">The United States in 2020&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The political situation in the United States right now is &lt;em>tense&lt;/em>, to say the least. President-elect Joe Biden won the 2020 general election. Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#bullshitter">the bullshitter&lt;/a> continues to make baseless claims of massive mail-in voter fraud to discredit the election results. No doubt the tens of millions of Americans duped into his &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality">personality cult&lt;/a> will fall for his lies, with some taking political action as we near &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration">inauguration day&lt;/a>. The rest of Americans are bewildered by how &lt;a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#troll">the troll&lt;/a> even got elected in the first place. So there is a heavy emotional and ideological divide in America today and I think any American half paying attention senses it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore I feel it my duty as a citizen to do what I can to bring people together in these divided times. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s good to create consensus for the sake of it by suggesting &lt;a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground">everyone take the middle ground&lt;/a>. No, the goal is to collectively arrive at &lt;strong>truth&lt;/strong>, which may or may not lie somewhere in the middle. So in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to suggest a technique I think will drastically improve the public discourse which, I feel, is one of America&amp;rsquo;s biggest problems right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-steel-man-technique">The Steel Man Technique&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Philosopher and cognitive scientist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett&lt;/a> described a method for arguing with a person that holds opposing views. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of the &lt;a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman">straw man fallacy&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s just the opposite of that. With the straw man, you misrepresent your opponent&amp;rsquo;s argument to make it easier to take down. With the steel man, you face the most charitable interpretation of your oppenent&amp;rsquo;s argument. There are 4 steps to steelmanning as explained by Dennett:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h4 id="step-1">Step 1&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first 3 steps comprise the steel man tactic. What I like about the first step is it forces you to understand your target&amp;rsquo;s position. If you restate your target&amp;rsquo;s position and they don&amp;rsquo;t agree with your summary, then allow them to correct you. Expressing your target&amp;rsquo;s position in your own words in a way they agree with shows that you actually &lt;em>understand&lt;/em> their argument. &lt;strong>You can&amp;rsquo;t argue against a position you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it, how can you know that you disagree?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-2">Step 2&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Step 2 is the most important step. It gives you credibility. It shows you&amp;rsquo;re interested in arriving at the truth, not just winning the argument. You don&amp;rsquo;t see it in politics because most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s just about winning the argument. Politicians think that if they give their opponent an inch, then they&amp;rsquo;re conceding the entire debate. But by refusing to concede on any points, or at least refusing to validate the reasons behind those points, they lose all credibility. They show themselves uninterested in understanding the other side&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you should take the &lt;a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground">middle ground&lt;/a>. I absolutely disagree with that. In some cases, your target is just going to be wrong on every point. In those cases, agreeing with your target is inappropriate. What I recommend instead is trying to relate in any other way to what your target is saying. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s important that you never assume your target&amp;rsquo;s motivation for making an argument.&lt;/strong> Otherwise, you risk creating a straw man, patronizing them and turning them off to what you&amp;rsquo;re about to say. If you do make an assumption about your target&amp;rsquo;s reasons for making an argument, always phrase it as a question leaving open the chance for them to interject. &lt;strong>Whatever you do, don&amp;rsquo;t skip step 2. Without step 2, it&amp;rsquo;s not steelmanning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-3">Step 3&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The third step allows your target to feel good about themselves before you engage them. It shows them that they added value to your life by teaching you something new. For example it could be what makes the argument appeal to them. The point may have already been &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Point_refuted_a_thousand_times">refuted 1,000 times&lt;/a>, but maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something novel that appeals to the person you&amp;rsquo;re talking to about that argument that you never considered. You&amp;rsquo;re not always going to learn something from your target. My advice for this step is to be genuine. If you do learn something, tell the target. If not, don&amp;rsquo;t act like you did. That&amp;rsquo;s disingenuous and could damage your credibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-4">Step 4&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The step you&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for! In step 4 you get to tear down your target&amp;rsquo;s argument. Remember you are tearing down the argument, not the person. &lt;strong>Never tear down the person unless their character is directly relevant to the subject of debate.&lt;/strong> If I&amp;rsquo;m debating with someone about health care in the United States, that person&amp;rsquo;s character is totally irrelevant to the conversation. If I&amp;rsquo;m running for public office, then my character is directly relevant to my campaign. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about the issues. It&amp;rsquo;s about who I am because you can&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;ll faithfully execute my duties unless you know I&amp;rsquo;m credible. In that case it &lt;em>does&lt;/em> make sense to criticize the person.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-steelmanning-works">Why Steelmanning Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Evolution hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up with modern society. It&amp;rsquo;s a slow process that takes millions of years. Meanwhile society has advanced rapidly, especially since the scientific revolution. A vestige of our caveman past is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response_(in_humans)">fight-or-flight response&lt;/a> in our reptile brains. Back when our species was hunter-gatherer, threats were constant and danger was all around us. Nowadays, especially in civilized societies, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about that as much. But when our core beliefs are challenged, it can still trigger the ancient fight-or-flight response. Once that happens, we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be really listening to our debate opponent. We also subconsciously identify with our beliefs. When those beliefs are challenged, our very identity is called into question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason steelmanning is effective is it lowers a person&amp;rsquo;s psychological barriers to criticism. By making your target feel heard, validating their points, and showing them you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the truth even if you&amp;rsquo;re wrong, you lower their guard so they&amp;rsquo;ll be more willing to hear your opinion. Steelmanning is completely independent of your political affiliation. Anyone with any set of beliefs can practice steelmanning. If more people did this, it could &lt;em>vastly&lt;/em> improve public discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tact">Tact&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You are going to hear good criticisms of your beliefs from people that have poor tact. It&amp;rsquo;s important not to throw out criticism just because it comes from someone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use steelmanning. I value diversity in argument techniques. We don&amp;rsquo;t need &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> steelmanning all the time. &lt;a href="https://christopherhitchens.net/">Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a> was a world renowned debater and he definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t known for politeness, yet he was &lt;em>far&lt;/em> from ineffective. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote by him:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;My own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, any place, any time. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line, and kiss my ass.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hitchens was a legend no doubt. He managed to be effective in debates and win an audience even though he enjoyed being rude to people. He had tact. Most of us can&amp;rsquo;t do that. It takes a very witty person to pull it off the way he did. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that there&amp;rsquo;s a large variety of ways people debate. &lt;strong>There isn&amp;rsquo;t one right way to debate because different tactics appeal to different audiences.&lt;/strong> But there was only one Hitchens. Therefore, our public discourse in the United States would be best served by moving in a more &amp;ldquo;Dennett&amp;rdquo; direction instead of a more &amp;ldquo;Hitchens&amp;rdquo; direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the steel man technique, we stand a better chance at bridging the political divide and having more fruitful conversations with those we disagree with. Every American half paying attention realizes how important it&amp;rsquo;s going to be that we can have those conversations as we near inauguration day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newcomb's Paradox Resolved</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/newcombs-paradox-resolved/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/newcombs-paradox-resolved/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I &amp;ldquo;solved&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb's_paradox">Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox&lt;/a> about 3 years ago if I remember right. I use solved in quotes because you don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;solve&amp;rdquo; a paradox. Paradoxes only &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> to be contradictory at first glance. But, upon further inspection, they lead you to a new understanding of the problem where the paradox disappears. In other words, paradoxes arise out of a flawed or incomplete perspective. Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s paradox in particular arises out of a misunderstanding of &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">free will&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="telescoping-methoda-nametelescoping_methoda">Telescoping Method&lt;a name="Telescoping_Method">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before I give away the &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; to Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox, I want to talk about my method for solving philosophical problems in general. I call it the &lt;strong>telescoping method&lt;/strong>. When I am confronted with a philosophical problem, the first thing I do is try to understand the &lt;em>essence&lt;/em> of the problem. To do that, I look at which &lt;em>abstractions&lt;/em> the problem uses. I break them down and down until the problem makes sense. Then, one by one, I build up the abstractions again so I can explain in words what the solution is. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be very effective for philosophy. I&amp;rsquo;ll use Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox to show how it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="newcombs-paradox">Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem from Wikipedia (&lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is an infallible predictor, a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Box A is clear, and always contains a visible $1,000.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the predictor has predicted the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The player does not know what the predictor predicted or what box B contains while making the choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="the-paradox">The Paradox&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s make it clear why this situation is a paradox before we attempt to resolve it. We are going to assume that the player is trying to maximize their profits. There are 2 strategies from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory&lt;/a> that you can apply to Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis">expected utility hypothesis&lt;/a>. It says you should take only box B. Its reasoning goes like this: Imagine you watched 1,000 philosophers play. Philosophers are split 50/50 on the issue, so about 500 would pick only box B, winning $1,000,000 and about 500 would pick both boxes, winning $1000. From a statistical standpoint, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious you should pick box B.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">strategic dominance principle&lt;/a>. It says you should take boxes A and B. Its reasoning goes like this: After the predictor has made its prediction and either put the $1,000,000 in box B or not, it can&amp;rsquo;t change the amounts in the boxes. Therefore, choosing both boxes will always yield $1000 more than choosing only box B. You should take both boxes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, both of these principles seem very compelling. It&amp;rsquo;s paradoxical because they offer conflicting advice. How can we resolve this?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="abstractions">Abstractions&lt;/h4>
&lt;h5 id="the-infallible-predictor">The Infallible Predictor&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>As I suggested in the &amp;ldquo;telescoping method&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re going to break down the abstractions and make the problem more concrete. First, let&amp;rsquo;s take note of the infallible predictor. Philosophically speaking, infallible predictors are really controversial. But we actually don&amp;rsquo;t need an infallible predictor at all. Using basic algebra:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Let p be the probability that the predictor is correct. Then:&lt;br>
&lt;code>1000000p&lt;/code> is the expected value if you choose only box B.&lt;br>
&lt;code>1000000(1-p) + 1000&lt;/code> is the expected value if you choose both boxes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>1000000p &amp;gt; 1000000(1-p) + 1000&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>=&amp;gt; 1000p &amp;gt; 1000(1-p) + 1&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>=&amp;gt; 1000p &amp;gt; 1000 - 1000p + 1&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>=&amp;gt; 2000p &amp;gt; 1001&lt;/code>&lt;br>
&lt;code>=&amp;gt; p &amp;gt; 0.5005&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore the expected value if you choose only box B is greater than the expected value if you choose both boxes so long as the predictor is over 50.05% accurate, slightly better than a coin toss.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>An AI system that can predict slightly better than a fair coin toss could create the Newcomb Paradox. Given what AI is already capable of, this is a realistic scenario. It also shows that the infallible predictor isn&amp;rsquo;t the root cause of the paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="intent">Intent&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>If it&amp;rsquo;s not the infallible predictor causing the paradox, could the essence of the paradox have something to do with your intent? Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell us that the predictor makes its prediction based on your intent. All it tells us is that the predictor is infallible. Therefore intent is irrelevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if your sincere intention is to pick only box B before the predictor makes its prediction, yet you change your mind and choose both boxes in the after prediction stage, the predictor will still correctly predict your choice and you will only win $1000.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="choice">Choice&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We already examined the infallibility of the predictor and the player intent abstractions. They don&amp;rsquo;t seem to cause the paradox. Perhaps the abstraction of choice is the problem? Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox assumes it makes sense to talk about the player making a &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; between 2 boxes and 1 box. But language to describe making a choice between several options is used in plenty of game theory problems. Even though I have shown that &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">free will is incoherent&lt;/a>, using what I call &amp;ldquo;the language of free will&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be an issue for other game theory problems. Why then would it be especially problematic in Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox? Allow me to defer to some dialogue between Neo and The Oracle from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Oracle&lt;/strong>: Candy?&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Neo&lt;/strong>: Do you already know if I&amp;rsquo;m going to take it?&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Oracle&lt;/strong>: Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much of an oracle if I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Neo&lt;/strong>: But if you already know, how could I make a choice?&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Oracle&lt;/strong>: Because you didn&amp;rsquo;t come here to make the choice. You&amp;rsquo;ve already made it. You&amp;rsquo;re here to try to understand why you made it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Just replace Neo with the player and the Oracle with the predictor and it&amp;rsquo;s the same concept. It seems we have found the essence of the problem. Free will is our leaky abstraction. The problem is the player can&amp;rsquo;t really make a choice because, from the predictor&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it has already been made. This leak can be ignored in most situations, but not with Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox. The paradox arises &lt;em>because&lt;/em> we use language of free will. Talking as if others are free agents is built right into language. So what &lt;em>can&lt;/em> we say about Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-solution">The &amp;ldquo;Solution&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>TLDR; choose only box B.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long answer: There is a &lt;em>very subtle&lt;/em> contradiction in the definition of Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox. Can you spot it? It says &amp;ldquo;The player does not know what the predictor predicted or what box B contains while making the choice&amp;rdquo;. The hidden assumption there is that the &amp;ldquo;choice point&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the predictor&amp;rsquo;s prediction. This is impossible. The abstraction of choice collapses after the predictor has made the prediction. If we have to pick a point in time where it still makes any sense to talk about a &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; being made, it would have to be &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the predictor made the prediction. &lt;strong>The strategic dominance principle is &lt;em>inherently&lt;/em> tied to the idea of the player having a free choice &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the predictor made the prediction&lt;/strong>. Therefore, it can&amp;rsquo;t be the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile taking only box B is supported by mathematical expected value, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on free choice being available after the prediction. It just says &amp;ldquo;If you take only box B, you can &lt;em>expect&lt;/em> $1,000,000. If you take both boxes, you can &lt;em>expect&lt;/em> $1,000&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s no notion of free will there. It&amp;rsquo;s a purely statistical argument. The strategic dominance principle only seems appealing because of the strong intuition of having a free choice &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the predictor has made the prediction. While &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality">retrocausality&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually occur in Newcomb&amp;rsquo;s Paradox, it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad mental model for thinking about the problem. Since the predictor is infallible, it has &lt;em>effective retrocausality&lt;/em>. What the predictor did in the past is based on the box it already knows you&amp;rsquo;re going to take. There&amp;rsquo;s no real paradox, you just can&amp;rsquo;t outwit the predictor even though your intuitions tell you that you &amp;ldquo;feel free&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to prescribe players the strategy of choosing box B only, since they have &amp;ldquo;already made the choice&amp;rdquo; whether or not to take only box B. But, consider that by the same token, we have &amp;ldquo;already made the choice&amp;rdquo; whether or not to prescribe the player the strategy to take box B. So, it is equally coherent for us to prescribe the player to take box B as it is for the player to actually take box B. Saying there&amp;rsquo;s no point in prescribing the player a course of action is akin to saying you&amp;rsquo;ll just stay in bed all day since you have no free will. The &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; to do nothing is &lt;em>also&lt;/em> not of your own free will. In other words, you&amp;rsquo;re not escaping your lack of free will by doing nothing. We aren&amp;rsquo;t escaping the lack of the player&amp;rsquo;s free will by not prescribing them a best course of action as we don&amp;rsquo;t have free will either. So, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason not to tell the player to take only box B.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing">Closing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some of the points I&amp;rsquo;ve written down in this post come from my own intuition. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a single methodology for how I come up with it all. In philosophy, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to define a single methodology that can solve problems since each problem is unique and touches on many different things. Maybe some day someone will come up with an algorithm for doing philosophy. Although that would be equivalent to &lt;a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=leX541Dr2rU">finding an algorithm for truth&lt;/a>, so no one would be able to agree that it actually worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, the &lt;a href="#Telescoping_Method">telescoping method&lt;/a> is good for getting you on the right track. It can also lead you down rabbit holes. I would caution that you don&amp;rsquo;t try to break down abstractions more than necessary. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason we have abstractions. They make it easier to think. Once you start breaking them down, the conceptual complexity increases. For example, if instead of talking about boxes I started talking about the billions of atoms that make up the boxes, that just makes it harder to think about the problem. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t add clarity. Be careful not to do that unnecessarily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, in these dense philosophical essays, I welcome &lt;a href="mailto:nicholasjohnson@posteo.org">criticism&lt;/a>. About half of philosophers think you should take both boxes, so don&amp;rsquo;t get the impression that my opinion is the only one. If you think I&amp;rsquo;m wrong about the paradox, I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback.

He represents moral goodness and justice. He is loved by millions. But he isn&amp;rsquo;t brave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, he &lt;em>can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> be brave. To understand why, let&amp;rsquo;s start by enumerating his superpowers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Superhuman strength, intelligence, speed, hearing and vision&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ability to fly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instant healing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>X-ray vision&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat vision&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eidetic memory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ice breath&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fire breath&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Telepathy and more&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>He has dozens more superpowers, but you get the idea. He&amp;rsquo;s basically a living god. He knows he&amp;rsquo;ll win every battle in advance. He need not fear his opponents. If anything doesn&amp;rsquo;t go his way, he can just reverse the earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation to turn back time. The only internal struggle he has to worry about is finding out who the bad guys are and deciding if he should intervene or not. That&amp;rsquo;s why Superman isn&amp;rsquo;t brave. &lt;strong>Vulnerability is necessary for bravery&lt;/strong>, and Superman can&amp;rsquo;t be vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Real bravery is many things. It&amp;rsquo;s having the moral strength to face danger, fear and adversity despite not knowing how things will work out. Bravery is taking the road less traveled instead of the beaten path. It is marching to the beat of your own drummer, refusing to conform to society&amp;rsquo;s standards. It is confronting your worst fears. It is doing the right thing when others turn a blind eye. Bravery is staying true to yourself in tough circumstances. It goes hand in hand with fear and uncertainty. &lt;strong>Bravery isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, but it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> contagious&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all have our own personal struggles. Then there are struggles we share in common with everyone else. We all get sick. We grow old and frail and eventually we die. We aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed of a good outcome in life. We face a universe that is indifferent to our existence. There&amp;rsquo;s a real possibility that our species could destroy itself, forever extinguishing the only source of intelligent life we know of. But confronting that reality isn&amp;rsquo;t something we do by choice. Even for people that seem to ignore reality, it&amp;rsquo;s still there in the very back of their mind, often expressing itself in indirect ways. As such, facing reality isn&amp;rsquo;t usually seen as bravery since we have no other option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, I want to give you something to consider: If you look at people who have acted bravely in the name of justice or good, they often did so because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue any other way. Their &lt;em>psychic reality&lt;/em> more or less forced them into bravery. Look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden&lt;/a> for example. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, he put his life and freedom at risk to tell the American people that our government is illegally spying on all of us. Here is what he said:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If I had just wanted to harm the US? You could shut down the surveillance system in an afternoon. But that&amp;rsquo;s not my intention. I think for anyone making that argument they need to think, if they were in my position and you live a privileged life, you&amp;rsquo;re living in Hawaii, in paradise, and making a ton of money, &amp;lsquo;What would it take you to leave everything behind?'&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can tell he felt an obligation toward his country and that obligation, for him, outweighed his own life. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to be brave in leaking classified documents. He simply found himself in a situation where his conscience wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let him ignore the injustice of mass surveillance any longer. With Snowden, 2 things are clear. Number 1 is he felt that something wrong was going on in government and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand idly by. Number 2 is he felt that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk away from it because if he didn&amp;rsquo;t speak up, no one else would. Combine those 2 factors and you see he was basically forced into whistleblowing. Just because you are forced into a difficult situation, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean enduring it isn&amp;rsquo;t brave or noble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I decided to &lt;a href="../../tags/testimony">drop my university classes&lt;/a> in order to keep my &lt;a href="https://www.fsf.org/philosophy">computing freedom&lt;/a>, I found myself in a similar situation to Snowden, albeit with less extreme consequences. I felt there was an injustice being done in the university that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore. And there was no way for me to challenge the proprietary software from within the university. I had exhausted my available options, so I was forced into dropping classes. It only felt right to make a strong statement about why I left which is why this blog even exists. Voices outside of the free software community and even a few within it told me I was making a big mistake. I still stand by that decision today because I realized that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do what I had done, nobody else would. Student groups at my university had already tried unsuccessfully to get professors to use different software. Through my efforts, I made the issue of free software known to many students and professors, got the department chair to mention the ethical concerns during class, gained informative experiences, started this blog, inspired members of the &lt;a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF&lt;/a> and hopefully showed other students fighting for computing freedom in education that they are not alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to go full martyr like Snowden or sacrifice as much as I did to be brave. Some would say what I did was foolish, not brave. But the point is bravery can be any situation where you are vulnerable, but you persist anyway. It can be conquering a phobia, trying new things, putting yourself out there, or facing difficult tasks head on. Acting in spite of your fear is what bravery feels like. Try being brave even for 30 seconds per day. Don&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm yourself, but do something where you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the outcome will be. If you do that enough times, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain confidence in uncertain situations and it might just change your life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Logic</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/thoughts-on-logic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/thoughts-on-logic/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="logic-in-education">Logic in Education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The term &amp;ldquo;critical thinking&amp;rdquo; gets thrown around a lot in schools, but children aren&amp;rsquo;t ever sat down and &lt;em>explicitly&lt;/em> told how to think. Logic needs to be introduced in primary school and reaffirmed throughout middle and high school (secondary school in the UK). &lt;strong>Knowing how to think logically is far more important than knowing how to calculate the area of a circle, how volcanoes work, or how to use a bunsen burner.&lt;/strong> And teaching it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be politically controversial because there&amp;rsquo;s an important distinction between telling kids &lt;em>what&lt;/em> to think versus teaching them &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to think. Logic is all about &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to think. That&amp;rsquo;s something we all should want others to know how to do well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The point of teaching the formal, symbolic logic starting at a young age is not so kids, teens and young adults become good at truth tables. The point is they&amp;rsquo;ll internalize logic like any other concept. The pattern recognition part of their brain will automatically recognize valid arguments when they see them. It will also recognize invalid forms of argument and logical fallacies without consciously doing any heavy lifting. That&amp;rsquo;s where the most value is in teaching logic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I studied philosophy in community college, I remember there was an art student. He had a great personality and was a very likeable person. Whenever he got called on to answer a question though, he was never able to produce the right answer. It was clear to me that he never learned &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to think logically. I wondered what it must be like to be a young adult never having learned that. There are also plenty of functioning older adults out there that never learned how to think logically. To be clear, studying formal logic isn&amp;rsquo;t a prerequisite for logical thought. What I find to be the case with nearly everyone without training in formal logic is that they have an intuitive sense of how to reason, but there&amp;rsquo;s important pieces of the puzzle they&amp;rsquo;re missing. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on in this post, the things that those without experience in formal logic get confused about. In my posts, I try not to assume prior knowledge, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain a bit about logic before I explain some of those missing pieces. If you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with logic, click &lt;a href="#Things_People_Get_Confused_About">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="logic">Logic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Logic is the study of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference">rules of inference&lt;/a>. Rules of inference allow you to draw conclusions based on premises. In other words, starting with a statement A, you can conclude statement B. For example, &lt;code>the earth is round&lt;/code> is a true statement. Therefore &lt;code>the earth is round or up is down&lt;/code> is also a true statement. In fact, I could replace the statement &lt;code>up is down&lt;/code> with any proposition Z and &lt;code>the earth is round or Z&lt;/code> would still be true. I used the rule of inference &amp;ldquo;addition&amp;rdquo; to draw my conclusion, so I&amp;rsquo;m guaranteed that it&amp;rsquo;s true no matter what Z is. I can apply another rule of inference to get &lt;code>humans have 3 legs therefore either the earth is round or up is down&lt;/code>. That is also a true statement. It sounds strange because the normal way of understanding &amp;ldquo;therefore&amp;rdquo; is as a causal relationship. In this context, it&amp;rsquo;s a strictly logical implication, not causal. Despite how strange it sounds, &lt;code>humans have 3 legs therefore either the earth is round or up is down&lt;/code> logically follows from &lt;code>the earth is round&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To test your skills in logic, I suggest trying out some logic puzzles such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves">Knights and Knaves&lt;/a>. If you get really ambitious, you can try your hand at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever">The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about what logic is, I want to talk about some of the important aspects of logic people commonly get confused about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="there-are-only-2-ways-an-argument-can-be-disproved">There Are Only 2 Ways an Argument Can Be Disproved&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first way to disprove an argument is by showing that one of the premises is false. The other way is showing that &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_validity">the &lt;em>structure&lt;/em> of the argument is invalid&lt;/a>. People are used to thinking of arguments in terms of &amp;ldquo;arguments for&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;arguments against&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get confused here. It&amp;rsquo;s the attitude &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s some good arguments for a proposition and some good arguments against it and it&amp;rsquo;s my job to weigh the pros and cons&amp;rdquo;. But, in logic, &lt;strong>an argument is either sound or unsound&lt;/strong>. The property of &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Soundness">soundness&lt;/a> means that the premises are true and it has valid form. If the conclusion of an argument derives from valid rules of inference based on the premises, then the only way to disprove the argument is to show one of the premises is false. If all the premises are true and the form is valid, then the argument is sound and the conclusion is true. There&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;arguments for&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;arguments against&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;maybe it&amp;rsquo;s wrong some other way&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s no two ways about it. No if, ands or buts. If an argument is sound, the conclusion necessarily follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-logical-fallacies-work">How Logical Fallacies Work&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning. It can be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy">formal&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy">informal&lt;/a>. Formal fallacies have to do with the &lt;em>structure&lt;/em> of an argument. If an argument has bad structure, it is invalid. Informal fallacies have to do with the &lt;em>content&lt;/em> of an argument. In my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s more rare for people to commit formal fallacies. This is because there are so many more ways to commit informal fallacies than there are ways to commit formal fallacies. There are only a few ways to structure an argument improperly, but there are virtually endless ways to get the content wrong since the content can be anything at all. Take a look at &lt;a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com">yourlogicalfallacyis.com&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s good to become familiar with informal fallacies by name and be able to call them out in realtime. To challenge yourself, try doing that during a live presidential debate. There&amp;rsquo;s so many logical fallacies in those it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep up, at least for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing people get confused about when they&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with logical fallacies is they think fallacies are a &lt;em>minor&lt;/em> problem for an argument, similar to the &amp;ldquo;arguments for&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;arguments against&amp;rdquo; I talked about earlier. They see the fallacy as the &amp;ldquo;argument against&amp;rdquo; part. That&amp;rsquo;s completely the wrong way to think about logical fallacies. &lt;strong>The presence of a single logical fallacy in an argument means that argument is toast.&lt;/strong> A logical fallacy is not a &amp;ldquo;counterpoint&amp;rdquo; to an argument. It &lt;em>fully&lt;/em> invalidates the argument. An entirely &lt;em>new&lt;/em> argument is needed to prove the conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important that you get it right if you do call out a fallacy. I often see people calling out fallacies that aren&amp;rsquo;t really there. The tendency by amateur logicians to call out fallacies that aren&amp;rsquo;t there might actually be just as prevalent as the tendency for amateur debaters to commit logical fallacies. That&amp;rsquo;s why practice at recognizing fallacies is key. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to mention every logical fallacy, just the ones I perceive as the most common. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the fallacy fallacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-fallacy-fallacy">The Fallacy Fallacy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Sometimes people think invalidating an argument by pointing out a logical fallacy disproves its conclusion. This is known as the &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy_fallacy">fallacy fallacy&lt;/a>. &lt;strong>A conclusion is like a destination you want to reach. Premises are where you begin. And an argument is the pathway from the premises to the conclusion.&lt;/strong> There are many different paths you can take to go from origin to destination. Just because one path doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean other paths can&amp;rsquo;t. In other words, true statements can be defended with false logic. Perhaps the argument is bad because the premises are faulty. In that case, you need to find alternative premises to make your argument. The other case is the logic is invalid, the form is wrong. In that case, you can keep your premises but you need to fix the form. In the worst case, your argument is unsalvageable and you need to use different premises &lt;em>and&lt;/em> different rules of inference to get to your conclusion. But just because you can&amp;rsquo;t make an argument for a conclusion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the conclusion is false. Even if no one on earth can make a sound argument for a conclusion, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the conclusion is false.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-burden-of-proof">The Burden of Proof&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof">burden of proof&lt;/a> is the obligation to supply evidence for a claim. The reason it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;guilty or not guilty&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;guilty or innocent&amp;rdquo; is because the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt. You are innocent until proven guilty. The &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis">null hypothesis&lt;/a> is innocence. But the concept of the burden of proof applies far outside the courtroom. It&amp;rsquo;s important in philosophy and it often gets misused. Shifting the burden of proof fallacy occurs when someone makes a claim, then when you demand evidence, they demand you prove the opposite. See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillahunty#Gumball_analogy">the gumball analogy&lt;/a> for further explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some cases, it may not even be possible to provide evidence to disprove a claim, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the claim is true. See &lt;a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/">Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Russell%27s_Teapot">Russell&amp;rsquo;s Teapot&lt;/a>. In debates about the existence of god, shifting of the burden of proof is an extremely common fallacy committed by theists. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t prove god doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist!&amp;rdquo;. Crucially, the burden of proof lies on the one making the claim. If I claim &amp;ldquo;There is a god&amp;rdquo;, I have the burden of proving it. If I claim &amp;ldquo;There are no gods&amp;rdquo;, then I have the burden to prove that. If I claim &amp;ldquo;There are &lt;em>probably&lt;/em> gods&amp;rdquo;, then I have the burden of proving that there are &lt;em>probably&lt;/em> gods. If I claim &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s possible for a god to exist&amp;rdquo;, then I have to somehow prove that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>possible&lt;/em>, that there&amp;rsquo;s a greater-than-zero chance of it occurring. So on and so forth for every claim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; in this context isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to hard, physical evidence. In &lt;a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com">The Simulation Argument&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers">Nick Bostrom&lt;/a> demonstrates that there is a 1 in 3 probability that we are living in a simulation despite not referencing any direct physical evidence of a simulated universe. It would be hard to say what direct evidence of a simulated universe would even look like. His paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on that many external observable facts about the physical universe either. The assumptions he does rely on to make his argument are fairly uncontroversial, which makes his strong result all the more surprising. It just goes to show there are many ways to meet the burden of proof for a claim, not all relying on hard physical evidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ad-hominem-fallacy">Ad Hominem Fallacy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There are several ways people get confused over the argumentum ad hominem. The &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_hominem">ad hominem fallacy&lt;/a> is a logical fallacy where you attempt to refute someone&amp;rsquo;s argument by attacking their character. &lt;strong>If you attack someone&amp;rsquo;s character, that might harm their credibility. But, a person&amp;rsquo;s credibility has nothing to do with the logical soundness of their argument. Soundness of an argument depends &lt;em>only&lt;/em> upon the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m not saying credibility isn&amp;rsquo;t important. It is. Credibility may influence your willingness to believe claims made by someone, but that&amp;rsquo;s a separate issue. Your willingness to believe someone also bears no relation to the soundness of their argument or the truth of the claim they&amp;rsquo;re making. The soundness of a logical argument is independent of the reputation of the person making it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet another way people misunderstand the ad hominem fallacy is they think it&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to being mean or sarcastic in an argument. &lt;strong>An ad hominem fallacy occurs when someone attempts to disprove your argument by attacking you personally. If they attack you personally and disprove your argument separately, that&amp;rsquo;s not an ad hominem fallacy. That&amp;rsquo;s just them being rude.&lt;/strong> Yes it would be nice if people were compassionate to others all the time, but being rude in a debate doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as a fallacy. See examples in &lt;a href="https://laurencetennant.com/bonds/adhominem.html">the ad hominem fallacy fallacy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tu-quoque-fallacy">Tu Quoque Fallacy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Tu Quoque translates into &amp;ldquo;you too!&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s also known as the appeal to hypocrisy and &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Whataboutism">whataboutism&lt;/a>. This one is most often used in political debates between candidates to attack each other&amp;rsquo;s credibility and (seemingly) invalidate their opponent&amp;rsquo;s argument. The idea is if you can call someone a hypocrite, that invalidates their argument. Obviously it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;ve been over that. The only way to invalidate an argument is by showing the premises to be false or the structure to be invalid. It might be a good strategy for &amp;ldquo;winning&amp;rdquo; a debate as judged by laypeople with no training in logic, but calling someone a hypocrite does nothing against their argument, even if they are in fact a hypocrite. I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard it explicitly said that someone&amp;rsquo;s argument is wrong because they are a hypocrite, only implied. This basically goes back to a person&amp;rsquo;s credibility being irrelevant to the truth of their argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="bad-heuristics">Bad Heuristics&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There are several logical fallacies which fall into the category of what I call &amp;ldquo;bad &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. They are &lt;em>substitutes&lt;/em> for using logic to make up your own mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="bandwagon">Bandwagon&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>This one is the most widely-known. It simply means that many people believe something, so it must be true. There may be an evolutionary/psychological pressure to conform to what everyone else believes since it&amp;rsquo;s perceived as the safest option. Several studies have been done showing that if you put a test subject in a group where the majority believes something, even if it&amp;rsquo;s completely irrational, the subject will often just go along with it. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations">Roughly 85% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population believes in some form of god or gods&lt;/a> depending on how you ask the question. There&amp;rsquo;s no evidence for the existence of any gods, so their beliefs are unfounded. In other words, just going along with what everyone else believes is a bad heuristic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="genetic">Genetic&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The genetic fallacy is whenever someone says something is good or true because it comes from a certain source. We can look at the media for example. While it is certainly true that some news sources are more reliable than others, the truth of an argument doesn&amp;rsquo;t change depending on which news source makes it. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t diminish the importance of having reliable sources of news. As a personal example, when &lt;a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers">Nick Bostrom&lt;/a> releases a new paper, I make an educated guess that I&amp;rsquo;ll find it interesting based on his previous work being interesting. But the new paper that I read won&amp;rsquo;t be interesting &lt;em>because&lt;/em> all his previous work is. It will be interesting because of the contents of the paper. If you pick good sources of information, then that&amp;rsquo;s actually not a bad heuristic for truth. You will only end up with a bad heuristic for truth if you pick bad sources of information, such as Facecrook. Just remember that the source of information has no bearing on the truth of the information. I&amp;rsquo;m really beating this point to death, but it bears repeating. The only determining factors for the soundness of an argument are the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="nature">Nature&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The appeal to nature fallacy happens when someone says something is good, just or ideal because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;. Two problems with that. For one, everything that happens is natural because we live in the natural world. But let&amp;rsquo;s entertain the fallacy for a moment and define &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; as things that aren&amp;rsquo;t products of human intelligence. By that definition, coronavirus is natural. Natural disasters are natural. It&amp;rsquo;s even in the name. Lots of horrible things are natural. &amp;ldquo;Unnaturalness&amp;rdquo; is often used to argue against homosexuality. Other species of primate also show homosexual behavior, so homosexuality is natural even in non-human animals. To sum up, appealing to nature is a bad heuristic since it&amp;rsquo;s hard to define what counts as natural and many natural things everyone agrees are natural are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> good, while things people call &amp;ldquo;artificial&amp;rdquo;, such as vaccines, &lt;em>are&lt;/em> good.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="middle-ground">Middle Ground&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Taking the &amp;ldquo;middle ground&amp;rdquo; position between two extremes is probably an even poorer heuristic for truth than the bandwagon. People think taking the middle ground means they&amp;rsquo;re unbiased. They think having an &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; position means you are heavily biased. They perceive the middle ground as &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; and fair. But how do you go about deciding where the extremes are? Popular opinion? If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, then we&amp;rsquo;re back at the bandwagon fallacy. If you have some other way of determining the extremes, then what is it exactly? What if the middle ground is ambiguous?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being unbiased doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you take the middle ground on every issue. It just means you&amp;rsquo;re using another poor proxy for the truth because you can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to think for yourself. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to think that truth has to lie somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="anecdotal">Anecdotal&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Personal experiences and isolated examples can be a bad heuristic for interpreting the world around you if you extrapolate them beyond their application. I sometimes use personal experiences as examples of things I already know to be true. But I&amp;rsquo;m not saying those things are true &lt;em>because&lt;/em> of my personal experiences. Quantitative scientific measures are more accurate than personal experiences because they are based on lots of data collected in a controlled way as opposed to individual isolated examples collected over a single human lifetime. To sum up this section, &lt;strong>trust the statistics&lt;/strong>. It&amp;rsquo;s not to say they can&amp;rsquo;t be wrong, but they have &lt;em>numerical&lt;/em> weight. As the saying goes, numbers don&amp;rsquo;t lie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That wraps it up for the bad heuristics. Now we can move from fallacies to something new: the limits of logic. This is more of a surprising result about logic that people aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of rather than something people get confused about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="logic-has-limits">Logic Has Limits&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>After you become really good at doing any type of logic, whether it be computational, mathematical, inductive, deductive, etc, you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s possible for logic to prove everything. Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not. And we can prove it&amp;hellip;using logic. Mind bending, right? But before we talk about that, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to explain axioms. If you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with axioms, feel free to &lt;a href="#G%C3%B6dels_Incompleteness_Theorems">skip&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="axioms">Axioms&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve said that for an argument to be valid, the premises must be true. But how do we know the premises are true? We could make another argument to prove each premise, but then we&amp;rsquo;ll just have the same problem we started with. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to prove each one of the premises that we used in our argument to prove our original premises. It&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Infinite_regress">infinite regress&lt;/a>. To resolve this, we need a starting point, an axiom. An &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Axiom">axiom&lt;/a> is a proposition that is taken for granted. It is assumed to be true without justification. There are various ideas about what axioms one should accept. Typically they tend to be kept as simple as possible. For example, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Essay:On_Logical_Absolutes">logical absolutes&lt;/a>: The Law of Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="gödels-incompleteness-theoremsa-namegödels_incompleteness_theoremsa">Gödel&amp;rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems&lt;a name="Gödels_Incompleteness_Theorems">&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>In the early 1920&amp;rsquo;s, famous German mathematician &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert&lt;/a> put forward a proposal calling for the axiomatization of mathematics. He wanted to make all mathematical truths reducible to an agreed upon set of axioms such that all true statements could be proved, but no false statements could be proved. In 1931, one of the most significant logicians in history, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel&lt;/a>, showed that &lt;strong>no set of axioms is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers&lt;/strong>. See &lt;a href="https://stopa.io/post/269">Gödel&amp;rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems&lt;/a>. Gödel used mathematical logic to show that there are some places mathematical logic cannot go. Boiled down, he proved that logic cannot prove everything. This is also true in computing. See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">The Halting Problem&lt;/a>. The essence of the trick seems to be, no matter which logic you&amp;rsquo;re talking about, to find a way to encode the &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Liar_paradox">liar paradox&lt;/a> in the system. A prerequisite for that is somehow getting the logical system to talk about itself. Gödel found a very fascinating theorem and I would recommend for anyone interested to look more in depth at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve got for this post. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve packed in a lot of information and good examples to research. Even if you never learn logic, I believe by reading this post you get a sense of what logic is all about and how to at least recognize some common informal fallacies and misunderstandings. I tried to include plenty of useful external links. This post is barely scratching the surface though. For some readers, just scratching the surface is good enough. But for all I know, the next Gödel might be reading this. &lt;a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=OZzIvl1tbPo">In 2011, a 25-year old math problem about superpermutations was solved by an anonymous 4chan user&lt;/a>. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t show that cleverness can come from anywhere, I don&amp;rsquo;t what does.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide">nothing to hide&lt;/a>, although that is also a very common attitude. It has been refuted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_nauseam">ad nauseum&lt;/a> by privacy advocates, so I won&amp;rsquo;t do it again here. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the feeling people have that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_state">corporate/government surveillance state&lt;/a> (Big Brother) will collect their data one way or another no matter what, so there&amp;rsquo;s no point in even trying to avoid mass surveillance. Privacy is already dead. Mass surveillance and its &lt;a href="https://www.socialcooling.com/">long-term negative side-effects&lt;/a> are inevitable. That&amp;rsquo;s the attitude of so many people and it&amp;rsquo;s disappointing. So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to offer an alternative way to think about privacy and surveillance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s be clear. &lt;strong>Privacy is not just a personal preference. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a social necessity either. It&amp;rsquo;s a biological necessity as basic as breathing. It allows us all to be human. It is the right to be imperfect. Therefore, it &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be protected. There is no point in asking if it&amp;rsquo;s too late to stop mass surveillance because there&amp;rsquo;s no alternative to curtailing it. It must be stopped&lt;/strong>. &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.en.html">Democracy can only withstand so much surveillance&lt;/a>. Mass surveillance in its current form and true democracy &lt;em>cannot&lt;/em> coexist indefinitely. Surveillance tools combined with &lt;a href="https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai">AI&lt;/a> will only get more powerful as time passes. To put it frankly, we are either going to reign in mass surveillance or democracy will perish. We have to reject the defeatist excuse that we&amp;rsquo;ve already lost to mass surveillance and so we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even try to restore privacy. That&amp;rsquo;s just a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy">self-fulfilling prophecy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The alternative, yet realistic way of thinking (as opposed to defeatism) that I want to introduce is what I call &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;raising the bar on privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. It&amp;rsquo;s a very simple idea. Maybe Big Brother can still get our data even if we take steps to increase our privacy. Even if the defeatist is right that our data can or will be collected anyway, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make it as difficult as possible. Let&amp;rsquo;s not hand over our data on a silver platter at least, right? If enough of us take steps to increase our privacy, we will make it &lt;em>more difficult and more expensive&lt;/em> for Big Brother to collect our data. We collectively &amp;ldquo;raise the bar on privacy&amp;rdquo;. Even if we can&amp;rsquo;t fully insulate our own lives from Big Brother, if we can force Big Brother to resort to the more powerful means of surveillance (think &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">0-day exploits&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_surveillance">targeted surveillance&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_backdoor">hardware/firmware backdoors&lt;/a>) more often instead of the low-hanging fruit of collecting our data from big tech companies, then our society will gain several benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>As privacy-friendly tools gain popularity, people that use them won&amp;rsquo;t become especially &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; to Big Brother anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The desire for privacy won&amp;rsquo;t be viewed as a cause for suspicion of wrongdoing, but instead as a basic biological need that everyone is entitled to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The perception of increased privacy on its own will cause individuals to speak and act more freely, reducing &lt;a href="https://www.socialcooling.com">social cooling&lt;/a> and making it easier to speak out against mass surveillance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Big Brother will be forced into using more powerful surveillance tools more frequently to collect the same data it already does, thus increasing its public exposure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free software&lt;/a> will become more widespread since it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary precondition for digital privacy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">Proprietary software&lt;/a> will become less widespread since people will use free software in its place.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To sum up this post in a way that makes sense to security-minded people: our minimum acceptable lower bound for a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model">threat model&lt;/a> should be avoiding mass surveillance so that we raise the bar on privacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Legalize All Drugs</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/legalize-all-drugs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/legalize-all-drugs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="history-lesson">History Lesson&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A century ago, alcohol prohibition in the United States began with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">18th amendment&lt;/a> prohibiting the production, importation and sale of alcoholic beverages and ended in 1933 with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">21st amendment&lt;/a>. The goal of prohibition was to reduce alcohol consumption. While prohibition succeeded in reducing alcohol consumption somewhat, it resulted in many unintended consequences including public health problems, an increase in organized crime, and corruption of law enforcement. The war on &lt;del>drugs&lt;/del> otherwise peaceful people who choose to ingest intoxicants began in 1971 with Richard Nixon. &lt;del>&lt;del>It&amp;rsquo;s not that he refused to learn from the prohibition era. It was a calculated move with a political purpose. Namely, to target black people and anti-war hippies. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from John Ehrlichman, the domestic policy chief for the Nixon administration:&lt;/del>&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;del>&lt;del>You want to know what this was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I&amp;rsquo;m saying? We knew we couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did&lt;/del>&lt;/del>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit (2020/12/05):&lt;/strong> This quote is poorly sourced. Upon further research, it seems Nixon&amp;rsquo;s war on drugs wasn&amp;rsquo;t politically motivated despite still being a disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; only played a small part of law enforcement efforts on the whole until Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981. Reagan expanded the drug war with a focus on criminal penalties instead of treatment. His policies resulted in a massive increase in incarcerations of nonviolent drug users. His wife Nancy Reagan started the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No">Just Say No&lt;/a> campaign to teach schoolchildren not to use drugs. It was about as effective at reducing drug use as abstinence-based sex education is at reducing sex. The most popular Just Say No program, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education">DARE&lt;/a>, showed zero effect on drug use according to &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-just-say-no-doesnt-work">20 controlled studies&lt;/a>. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s because DARE spreads lies and gives children a contorted picture of the war on drugs? In 1986, congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act changing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_supervised_release">federal supervised release&lt;/a> programs increasing focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation, prohibiting &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance_analog">analogs of controlled substances&lt;/a> and requiring &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing">mandatory minimum sentences&lt;/a> for nonviolent drug users. The sentencing discrepency between crack and powder cocaine resulted in an uneven increase in incarceration rates for black people. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that sound familiar?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2020, a whole century since the beginning of prohibition era, there are signs that we are finally learning what history has to teach us: The unintended consequences of drug prohibition are worse than the problem it&amp;rsquo;s meant to solve. As of today, medical cannabis use is legalized in 35 states. The recreational use of cannabis is legalized in 15 states. 16 states have decriminalized cannabis use. Up to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/20/marijuana-legalization-federal-laws-100688">40 states might allow some form of marijuana legalization&lt;/a> by the end of 2020. Just a few days ago Oregon became the first state to legalize magic mushrooms for medical use and decriminalize &amp;ldquo;street drugs&amp;rdquo;. People found in possession of street drugs will face a ticket and a 100 dollar fine rather than a felony. They will optionally be offered treatment. Despite recent progress, the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; is still being waged almost 50 years later and drugs are cheaper and easier to acquire than ever. And that&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;re at today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could argue why drugs should be legalized without giving you the history lesson first, but historical context is important. It&amp;rsquo;s important to realize just how much harm the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; has already caused thus far. Millions of people&amp;rsquo;s lives have been destroyed due to the effects of the war on drugs to the point that it is now a pervasive part of our culture including literature, movies and music. Drug addiction ruins people&amp;rsquo;s lives, but the war on drugs has ruined more. I am arguing for legalization of &lt;em>all&lt;/em> drugs. I&amp;rsquo;m going to offer arguments for legalization from several different perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arguments-in-favor-of-legalization">Arguments in Favor of Legalization&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="personal-autonomy">Personal Autonomy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Drugs should be legal because your own body belongs to you, not the government. If I want to chop my finger off so I only have 4 fingers, I should be able to do it. You can say it&amp;rsquo;s the dumbest thing you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of, that something&amp;rsquo;s wrong with me, that no one in their right mind would do such a thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>my&lt;/em> finger. I&amp;rsquo;m not by any means comparing doing drugs to cutting your own finger off. Depending on which drug you do, it can be far less dangerous or far more dangerous than cutting your own finger off. Cutting your own finger off also doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any perceivable benefits whereas drugs do. That&amp;rsquo;s why people do them. Making this argument makes me sound like I lean libertarian, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think personal autonomy is without limits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With abortion, there is another life (or potential human life) at stake. Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, there is at least a potential human life there that you have to take into account in your calculation of banning abortion versus legalizing it. With suicide, it is your own life you are taking. It belongs to you. But it might make sense for agents of the state to have the authority to prevent you from committing suicide if you are in a crisis situation. Although it is your own life and belongs to you as far as the government should be concerned, your future self might be glad someone stopped you. Much like abortion, you can make the case that there is a potential happy human life that is being ended. With explicit informed patient consent as in euthenasia, that argument is much harder to make especially when someone is in great pain, terminally ill, and there is no prospect of future happiness. Anyway, the point is that personal autonomy isn&amp;rsquo;t an absolute. However, in general, you should be able to do whatever you want so long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t infringe upon the rights of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might object that while drug use may not infringe upon others' rights, it may affect them negatively even if you use drugs responsibly. So can watching too much TV, social media, and a million other things we don&amp;rsquo;t criminalize. While watching too much TV is bad for you, to criminalize watching too much TV would be tyrannical because it means the government &lt;em>gains&lt;/em> the right to restrict your viewing. My right to extend my fist ends at your face. Likewise, the right to do drugs, or as I&amp;rsquo;ll call it, the right to access alternative states of body and mind, means the government isn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to close you off from having certain types of experiences. If those states of mind produced by drugs are inconvenient for some government agenda like war, then that&amp;rsquo;s too bad. There is no &amp;ldquo;right for the government to restrict states of consciousness aversive to conflict&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, children should still be prohibited from doing drugs. Their brains aren&amp;rsquo;t fully developed yet and we have to have some legal cutoff point after which we assume people are intellectually and emotionally mature enough to decide what they want to do with themselves. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that cutoff point is, but we already use that reasoning for many laws. You have to be 17-18 for an unrestricted driving permit. You have to be 18 to get a tattoo (in most states), marry (except Nebraska) or vote. You have to be 21 to legally buy alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco products. You have to be 25 years old to be a representative in the House of Representatives, 30 to be a senator, and 35 to be president. You gain more privileges only as you get older, and for good reason. The easiest, least costly way for the government to determine maturity is just to use age as a proxy. You can argue all day about what the legal age should be for drugs. But, once that age is met, you should be able to legally do the drugs you want as a matter of personal autonomy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="eliminating-drug-cartels">Eliminating Drug Cartels&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Besides personal autonomy, there are also strong social reasons for legalizing all drugs. Legalizing all drugs would put an end to the drug cartels and their associated violence by taking away their profits and undermining their whole reason for existing. Drug cartels exist for a specific purpose. Any time you have a commercial enterprise, you need some way to enforce rules regarding the manufacture, distribution and sale of the product. For example, if your illegal product is stolen, you can&amp;rsquo;t exactly report it to law enforcement. There is no legal recourse you can take. So you resort to violence, or at least make a credible threat of violence to deter future stealing. If you don&amp;rsquo;t threaten violence, then you have no way to deter stealing and other undesirable behavior. Other competing cartels will use violence to further their operations and you will be &amp;ldquo;outcompeted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only would legalization help the United States, but it would also do a huge favor to Mexico which has been torn apart by the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo;. If the United States could legally produce its own drugs without having to import them in illegally from Mexico, then Mexican drug cartels would hemorrhage money. In fact, US border patrol has already seen a decrease in marijuana trafficking due to many states legalizing it. As the US continues to legalize drugs in more states, we can expect to see Mexican drug cartels lose even more market share until their demand completely disappears, replaced by legally operated businesses in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="money">Money&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results.&amp;rdquo; (Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you believe that quote, then the war on drugs is the definition of insanity. The US has spent over a trillion dollars waging the war on drugs for about half a century. Despite the cost, drug use has expanded. Economic productivity is sacrificed in favor of mass imprisonment of drug users. Even a single minor offense can cost a lifetime of economic opportunity. It can mean you aren&amp;rsquo;t eligible for certain jobs, health benefits or financial aid. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, &lt;a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp">roughly half of federal inmates are in prison for drug offenses&lt;/a>. In 2018, the Bureau of Prisons reported that the cost for federal inmates was $36,299.25 per year. By legalizing all drugs and pardoning all drug-related offenses, taxpayers could save about 3 billion dollars per year. Not to mention the DEA could be abolished saving tens of billions annually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Criminalization also burdens the healthcare system dealing with consequences of unsafe, contaminated drug use. Enforcement against drug paraphernalia causes sharing of needles which spreads disease. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as big of a problem if drugs were legalized since they would be regulated and tested for purity. Places that rely on tourism for economic activity are negatively affected when they are seen as dangerous due to drug cartel activity. Money that is spent on unregulated, illegal drugs can&amp;rsquo;t be spent on regulated, taxable and legal parts of the economy. Minorities and low income groups that are already economically vulnerable are more likely to be arrested for drugs, further decreasing future job prospects. Smaller economies are heavily distorted by the drug war. I could go on forever, but you can see that the drug war makes no sense from an economic standpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reducing-corruption">Reducing Corruption&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Wherever there is an organized illicit drug industry, there is also going to be police corruption. Mexico knows this all too well. In December 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-mexican-secretary-public-security-arrested-drug-trafficking-conspiracy-and">Genaro García Luna&lt;/a>, Mexico&amp;rsquo;s former minister in charge of the federal police for 6 years, was arrested for allegedly taking millions from the Sinaloa cartel in return for safe passage of the cartel&amp;rsquo;s drug shipments and information on other rival cartels. Just last month &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/mexico-general-cienfuegos-dea.html">General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda&lt;/a>, Mexico&amp;rsquo;s former army chief for 6 years, was arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. The CIA in the US was allegedly involved in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_involvement_in_Contra_cocaine_trafficking">cocaine trafficking&lt;/a> in which several investigations ensued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom line is dealing with the cartels is mutually beneficial for those in power, so long as they don&amp;rsquo;t get caught. Those in government and the police have all the wrong economic incentives when it comes to the drug war. In some government positions in countries with rampant corruption, it&amp;rsquo;s probably an unwritten job requirement to work with the cartels. We&amp;rsquo;ll probably never know which positions those are for sure though. Corruption happens in the shadows and it&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to produce any concrete evidence. Legalizing drugs would eliminate the cartel&amp;rsquo;s source of profit, which means politicians would no longer have any financial incentive to work with them. It follows that drug-related government and police corruption would decrease.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="improved-police-community-relations">Improved Police-Community Relations&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; is responsible for police militarization more than anything else. Peaceful protestors and rioters face chemical irritants, armored vehicles and riot gear because the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; has ensured police have military-style gear. Police militarization causes officers to view themselves as a confrontational force instead of community-oriented. In the eyes of the citizenry, this makes police look like an occupying force rather than public servants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not dumping all the blame on cops either. The job of police officers is to enforce the law. When the law is unjust, the police still have to enforce it. It&amp;rsquo;s not fair on them because it makes them look bad. Ending the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; would do so much for police-community relations. Children wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to watch their parents hauled off to jail for choosing to engage in a victimless activity. Families wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be torn apart. Drug-related police corruption would end, as I talked about in the above section. Police departments could shift their resources toward stopping murderers and rapists, people causing real harm to society. Without ending the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo;, public confidence in policing will continue to erode. In the year 2020 where we have &lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/06/12/nationwide-protests-over-police-brutality-continue-cities-across-us-cut-and">nationwide demonstrations against police brutality&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/22/anarchist-jurisdictions-portland-new-york-seattle">Justice Department declaring NYC, Portland and Seattle &amp;ldquo;Anarchist Jurisdictions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/minneapolis-police-abandon-precinct-after-protesters-set-it-on-fire">police abandoning precincts&lt;/a>, police definitely shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be perpetuating a failed drug war that has lasted half a century and will only further diminish public trust in the police.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="why-not-just-decriminalize">Why not just Decriminalize?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s and early 1990&amp;rsquo;s, 1 out of every 10 citizens in Portugal was addicted to heroin. To combat this, Portugal decriminalized all drug use. And it worked. Incarceration rates went down, infectious disease cases of HIV went down, and fatal overdoses went down. Decriminalization wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing that changed though. It was accompanied by a culture shift in the public attitude toward drugs and drug addiction. When your country isn&amp;rsquo;t busy locking people up over drugs, it can focus on helpful things like treatment, housing, and employment to help people recover. Several &lt;a href="https://www.inspiremalibu.com/blog/drug-addiction/10-countries-that-ended-their-war-on-drugs">other countries have ended their war on drugs&lt;/a>. So why not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> decriminalize drugs? Why the need to legalize?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, I need to explain the difference between the two. In general, decriminalization means that there are no longer &lt;em>criminal&lt;/em> penalties for an action. There may still be fines. Legalization means that the action is fully legal. There is no associated penalty. Drug possession should, without a doubt, at least be decriminalized because drug use isn&amp;rsquo;t a criminal issue. Drug manufacture can be regulated by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov">FDA&lt;/a>, but drug possession should be fully legalized. There is no reason to punish drug users &lt;em>solely&lt;/em> for possessing drugs whether that be fines or jail time. That&amp;rsquo;s why all drug possession should be legalized, not just decriminalized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to deter drug use, then there are better approaches than not fully legalizing drugs. This is where you could get creative. As a single example, turn the idea of a fine on its head. Offer a cash reward to addicts for staying clean. Consider cultural influences and other societal factors that may be causing people to turn toward drugs, such as poverty or mental illness. Perhaps the reason drug use is so high is because society has other problems that aren&amp;rsquo;t being attended to, and drugs are just a symptom of it. This is where policy could be informed by sociological research. If you think criminalizing or not fully legalizing drugs is the only way to deter their use, then I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to think more creatively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="drug-regulation">Drug Regulation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s move on to regulation. Regulation of drugs is important for ensuring drug quality, fair pricing, safety and education. But it&amp;rsquo;s also probably a good idea not to regulate drugs so heavily that a sizeable black market continues to exist. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to focus on regulation other than to say deciding on the regulations should be an evidence-based process. Lawmakers have almost 50 years of evidence on how not to treat drugs in society, so maybe they can learn from past mistakes and other countries that have decriminalized drugs and come up with regulations as drugs are legalized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="drug-education">Drug Education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As for education, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about some of the things schools shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do. First and foremost, school drug education programs should stop lying to children about drugs. Schools should stop teaching children that every hard drug user is an addict. Schools should stop teaching abstinence as the &lt;em>only&lt;/em> practical way of protecting oneself from harmful drugs. And they should stop using green-tinted goggles to mimic the effects of marijuana. &lt;a href="https://stonerthings.com/do-weed-goggles-work">Yes, they actually did that&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what should schools do? They should tell the truth. They should teach that the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; has been one of the greatest moral failures of our time, a colossal waste of money, time, resources and human life that could have been better spent on literally anything else. Education programs should provide a fairminded, evidence-based view of the advantages and disadvantages of drug use per each drug. Drug education programs need to instruct young adults which drugs are worth doing, which are not, how often and in what setting, once they are of age. Drug education should come before most young adults are offered drugs. Program instructors could be social workers instead of police officers because drug addiction is not a criminal issue. It&amp;rsquo;s a health issue. As we end the war on drugs, social workers should take responsibility for dealing with drug-related issues. Social workers can be trained based on prior drug research and hear testimony from non-addicted healthy drug users and addicts alike so they can get an accurate sense of the positive and negative effects of different drugs. This would put them in a good position to educate youth about drugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="post-drug-war-society">Post Drug War Society&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve covered a few points on education, how will we convert our current society into a post drug war society? One answer is we need better resources for treating drug addiction. Education can only do so much if there aren&amp;rsquo;t effective resources out there. Drug treatment centers don&amp;rsquo;t even have to abide by federal guidelines and it&amp;rsquo;s debatable if they even work at all. That has to change. They need to be evidence-based and evaluated for effectiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Legalization should also be accompanied by a culture shift. Once drugs are legalized, drug users won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be criminals. That will go a long way in making it easier for society not to demonize them. People that use drugs are not &amp;ldquo;bad people&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near that simple. There are as many reasons people use drugs as there are drugs. There are people that use drugs in a healthy, responsible way and people that don&amp;rsquo;t. As I said before, there needs to be more resources for drug users in order to promote responsible use. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard to provide resources for that in a society where drugs are heavily criminalized and stigmatized. In a society where drug use is criminalized and stigmatized, drug users have to hide their drug use from family, friends and strangers for fear of legal and social repercussions. This culture of secrecy causes needless psychological suffering for people that use drugs for the wrong reasons. The social stigma around drug use causes users not to seek out help when they desperately need it. That includes addiction treatment, healthcare and psychiatric help. In a society where drugs are legalized and not stigmatized, none of that would be an issue. Drug users could be more open about their habits and get the resources they need to be responsible without worrying about being shamed or arrested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; seems to be coming to an end, albeit slowly. It&amp;rsquo;s not over yet though. If not for the drug war, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Breonna_Taylor">Breonna Taylor&lt;/a> would still be with us. How many more people are going to have to spend years behind bars and forever be labeled felons for engaging in a victimless activity? How many more honest, otherwise law-abiding citizens are going to die for a war that should never have been waged to begin with? When is the needless violence perpetuated by the war on &amp;ldquo;drugs&amp;rdquo; going to finally end? Eventually, there will come a day when the very last person has their life ruined by the war on &lt;del>drugs&lt;/del> human beings. I hope that day comes sooner rather than later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eternal Here and Now</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-eternal-here-and-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-eternal-here-and-now/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="mental-exercise">Mental Exercise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I want to start this post with a few mental exercises. You&amp;rsquo;ll do them first, then I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain their purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine yourself, in first person, at a place you would like to be. If you like the beach, then imagine yourself at the beach. It&amp;rsquo;s not really important where, just that you can clearly picture it in your mind. Once you have an image in your mind, try to incorporate your other senses as well. If you&amp;rsquo;re picturing a beach, then imagine the sensation of the sand beneath your feet and in between your toes. You can also try the sensation of the wind blowing. If you succeed in that, then add in the sound of seagulls squawking. You can incorporate as many new features into your world as you want. Then when you finish, continue reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While you were imagining whatever place you picked, where were you? Where was the place you were imagining? As you incorporated more features into your imagination, where did those new features come from? Where did they go after you finished the exercise?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time for the second exercise. Stand up if you aren&amp;rsquo;t already. Take 2 steps forward. Where is the first step you took? Take another step. Recall the last step you just took. Where is it now? When is it? Where and when is it while you&amp;rsquo;re remembering it? You can sit back down now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third exercise involves paying close attention. Focus your attention on the sensation of breathing. Take a few breaths in and out, just focusing on breathing. If a thought comes careening into consciousness and it interrupts, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Just observe it the same way you observe your breathing. Expand your awareness as wide as it can go to other sensations in the body such as tension, tiredness, or restlessness. Don&amp;rsquo;t limit yourself to bodily sensations. Emotions of happiness, enjoyment, sadness, anger, disgust and anything without a noun attached to it is also permitted. Nothing that enters consciousness can be &lt;em>invalid&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s all valid and it&amp;rsquo;s all acknowledged. Just observe as much of it as you can. After you finish, continue reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the third exercise, here are some questions. Where were the sensations you noticed? If you noticed any thoughts during the exercise, where were those thoughts? Were they the same place as the sensations or a different place? Since I&amp;rsquo;m asking about them, you may be &lt;em>recalling&lt;/em> the thoughts and sensations. Where and when is your recollection of your thoughts and sensations?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more exercises, you can visit &lt;a href="https://www.headless.org/experiments-home.htm">headless.org&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend checking out the site. The experiments found there are clever. Different techniques work better for different people. You might find a technique which works better for you than the exercises I&amp;rsquo;ve written.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-point">What&amp;rsquo;s the Point?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve exhausted my allowance of strange sounding questions directed at the reader. For readers that don&amp;rsquo;t get the idea yet, I&amp;rsquo;m going to come out and say it. All these exercises are trying to get you to experience one thing: The only time and place is here and now. In objective reality, there are separate places and times. Events &amp;ldquo;happen&amp;rdquo; here, or there. They happen in the past, present or future. To say everything happens at the same time and place seems like gibberish. Who would say such a thing? The catch is, it&amp;rsquo;s meant in a very specific sense. I&amp;rsquo;m not denying that there&amp;rsquo;s a real world that persists independently of our experience. Trees that fall down in the forest do make a sound even if no one is there to hear it. I&amp;rsquo;m merely pointing out that to experience something is synonymous with it appearing in consciousness. Consciousness is the only place for anything to appear. Past events are just memories recalled in the present. Future possibilities are imagined in the present. The reality of our experience is always now. We all live in an Eternal Here and Now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Darth Vader of responses to this is &amp;ldquo;So what? What does it matter?&amp;rdquo;. It can be really hard to show someone why this matters if they don&amp;rsquo;t already see significance. There could be practical benefits to this kind of realization but the primary one is no longer being confused about what you are any more, and no longer suffering for it. People in the midst of this realization sometimes have a peculiar way of phrasing things. Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m happy&amp;rdquo;, they say &amp;ldquo;There is happiness&amp;rdquo; as in &amp;ldquo;Happiness is present in consciousness&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em>You&lt;/em> are never really happy, but &lt;em>there is&lt;/em> happiness sometimes. Our usual way of talking is with subject-object form. But the sensation of being a subject in relation to a separate, external world of objects is itself a sensation appearing in consciousness. &amp;ldquo;There is a sensation of I&amp;rdquo;. As a side note, none of this entails that it&amp;rsquo;s not useful or important to have a sense of personal identity. A sense of identity is socially necessary. The contrapositive of that is that in order to lose your sense of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to undergo social isolation as many monks do.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="am-i-just-an-observer">Am I just an Observer?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You might wonder after reading all this if you&amp;rsquo;re just some passive observer to this flow of experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve written at length about this before, but it&amp;rsquo;s certain that &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">you don&amp;rsquo;t have free will&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s possible through meditation and other means to notice this firsthand. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> either way about it, that you are doing things or that things are happening to you, we know neuroanatomically that the feeling of being the author of your actions, that you are doing things, has to be an illusion. There&amp;rsquo;s nowhere for the author to be hiding. There are only actions. And in that sense &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-2">you aren&amp;rsquo;t ultimately responsible for your actions&lt;/a>, at least not in a way that justifies punishment for the sake of it. It&amp;rsquo;s just because of the way language is that we have to talk about a &amp;ldquo;do-er&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; as if you could ever really separate the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no satisfying way I can answer the question directly because the question assumes it makes sense to talk about an observer separately from that which is being observed. My suggestion is that dualistic distinctions about the subjective nature of reality are arbitrary. In subjective reality, there is only a &amp;ldquo;happening&amp;rdquo;. Consciousness is just the word we use for the space that we imagine the happening taking place in. We imagine that experiences must occur in some place at some time, so we call that place consciousness. The phrase &amp;ldquo;consciousness and its contents&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be understood to indicate dualism I think. It&amp;rsquo;s just a way of talking. &amp;ldquo;Consciousness and its contents&amp;rdquo; gets across the idea that experience is ever-changing. Everything is transitory because the contents are always changing. And the phrase &amp;ldquo;a happening&amp;rdquo; standing on its own better communicates the idea that experience is non-dual, that there is no experiencer in addition to the experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One possible answer to the question &amp;ldquo;Am I just an observer of experience?&amp;rdquo; is that the question is incoherent. But perhaps the best response is &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s asking?&amp;rdquo;. In truth, it&amp;rsquo;s far more rich to directly experience no-self, The Eternal Here and Now, rather than trying to nail down answers to philosophical questions about subjectivity. When it comes to non-dual experience, words fail us because they differentiate. There&amp;rsquo;s no substitute for direct experience, so go try some more &lt;a href="https://www.headless.org/experiments-home.htm">exercises&lt;/a> and see what you find.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Free Software</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/use-free-software/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/use-free-software/</guid><description>&lt;p>In previous posts, I have mentioned a lot about free software versus proprietary software. But I have never dedicated a standalone post to free software, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing that now. While I find the history of &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software&lt;/a> fascinating, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into that in this post. This is more of a persuasive post. I want to convince you to use free software wherever possible &lt;em>rather than&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/">proprietary software&lt;/a>. There is a lot to be said on the subject. This post is about why you should use free software, not why you should code it. There &lt;em>are&lt;/em> plenty of incentives to code free software though. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to focus on the user is that there&amp;rsquo;s already so much free software out there, but it&amp;rsquo;s not getting anywhere near the usage it deserves.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-freelibre-software">What is Free/Libre Software?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The word &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;free software&amp;rdquo; means free as in freedom, not free as in price. Price isn&amp;rsquo;t the issue with free software, freedom is. For software to be free, it must have &lt;strong>the 4 essential freedoms&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to study how the program works and modify it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to redistribute copies of the program to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions of the program to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why Does it Matter?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why are the 4 freedoms important? The most &lt;em>relevant&lt;/em> answer I can give for software users is that it boils down to &lt;strong>social and economic control&lt;/strong>. The 4 freedoms prevent the developer of the software from wielding too much power over its users. I will start with freedom 0 and go one by one explaining how each freedom impacts the social system between developers and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="freedom-0">Freedom 0&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Freedom 0 ensures that the user can use the program however they wish. Without freedom 0, the developer of the software can impose rules about how the program may or may not be used. If you use the program in a way that the developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t approve of, then the developer may take legal action against you. This can be done with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement">EULA&lt;/a>s (End-user license agreements). Click-wrap licenses can even prevent users from knowing there are restrictions on the program&amp;rsquo;s use until after starting the installation process. Users may be prevented from publishing performance information about the program to compare it to competitors, trying to reverse engineer the program for learning, developing plugins for the program, or any number of other legitimate uses of the program. Developers telling users what they can and can&amp;rsquo;t do with programs on their own computer gives the developer tremendous control over the users. Freedom 0 prevents this by giving the user the right to do anything with the program that they are able to get it to do (within the bounds of other applicable laws).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="freedom-1">Freedom 1&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Programs are made up of &amp;ldquo;source code&amp;rdquo;. Source code is the developer-readable format of a program. Your average Joe could look at a program&amp;rsquo;s source code and it would look like gibberish. But a sufficiently skilled programmer could read the source code and make sense of the program. With compiled languages, developers cannot run a program from its source code. It has to be &lt;em>compiled&lt;/em> first. In summary, source code is the format the developer can understand the program and compiled code is the format the machine can actually run the program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the program is compiled, it&amp;rsquo;s prohibitively difficult to make sense of the program even for developers. One strategy developers use to prevent other developers from reverse-engineering their program is to write the source code, then release only the compiled version of the program to the public. This way, only the developer can understand what the program really does and how it works. Not only that, but only they can make changes to the program. These programs are known as proprietary programs. It puts the developer in a position of power over the user and incentivizes the developer to add features that might hurt the user since the user is powerless to remove the bad features. This is also not conjecture. Proprietary programs &lt;em>often&lt;/em> have malicious anti-features that benefit the developer and hurt the users such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM&lt;/a>, surveillance, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)">back doors&lt;/a>, censorship, &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-tethers.html">tethers&lt;/a> and other &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/">tyrannical anti-features&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to reverse engineer a compiled program, but it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely arduous process, especially for very large programs. Free software wants &lt;em>practical&lt;/em> freedom to understand and change the program, not freedom &lt;em>in theory&lt;/em>. Therefore, for Freedom 1 to be satisfied, the source code of the program must be distributed alongside the compiled version of the program. This ensures that anyone who uses the program has the opportunity to understand and modify it. This grants users &lt;strong>individual control&lt;/strong> over the program. With Freedom 1, developers have less incentive to add malicious anti-features since other developers might notice them. This could cause people not to use programs made by that developer and for the developer to lose respect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freedom 1 is necessary but incomplete. The problem is not everyone is a programmer, so not everyone has the skills to understand and modify their programs to their liking. They are still stuck with whatever the developer gives them. The freedom to study and modify the program means nothing to non-programmers. This is why we need Freedoms 2 and 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="freedom-2">Freedom 2&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Freedoms 2 and 3 together grant &lt;strong>collective control&lt;/strong> over the program. Freedom 2 grants the freedom to distribute exact copies of the program. If you enjoy a program, you can share it free of charge with your friends. And they can share it with their friends. Anyone who finds it useful can share it with others. If you have freedoms 0 and 1 but not 2, then you can do whatever you want with the program including studying and modifying it, but others can&amp;rsquo;t benefit because you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to share the program. What Freedom 2 prevents is the developer having power over the users via controlling program distribution. A developer can&amp;rsquo;t do things to &lt;em>prevent&lt;/em> others from sharing the program. This means the developer is not in sole control over the distribution of the program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example, Windows 10 is a proprietary operating system. An operating system is just a program that acts as a middleman (abstraction layer) between the user and the hardware. It manages system resources. Only Microsoft is allowed to distribute the Windows 10 operating system. You may not distribute it yourself. Secondarily, in order to unlock all the features of Windows 10, you have to buy a Windows 10 license from Microsoft. Microsoft is in control of the distribution of the license keys as well. If I distributed license keys for Windows 10 to others, there could be legal ramifications for me. Microsoft punishes sharing. Freedom 2 protects sharing of software with the idea that sharing is generally a good thing and should be encouraged. Sharing software isn&amp;rsquo;t like sharing physical goods. If 5 people share a pizza, everyone gets less pizza. But if 5 people use the same program, then all 5 get the full benefit of the program. The benefit I get out of using it is not degraded by sharing it with others. Software is not like a pizza. It&amp;rsquo;s more like a pizza recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="freedom-3">Freedom 3&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Continuing with the pizza analogy, Freedom 1 gives you the right to change the &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo;. You can make improvements and benefit from them. Freedom 3 lets you share your modified recipe with others so they can also benefit from your improvements. You can imagine a situation in which Freedoms 0, 1, and 2 are granted, but not 3. This would mean users can use the program any way they wish, modify it, and share exact copies, but not share modified copies. This is disastrous for collective control over the program. It would mean only the developer could make updates. &amp;ldquo;Forks&amp;rdquo; couldn&amp;rsquo;t be public. Everyone else is free to make changes, but non-programmers can&amp;rsquo;t benefit from those changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said before, free software is about &lt;em>practical&lt;/em> control over the program, not control &lt;em>in theory&lt;/em>. In reality, non-programmers can&amp;rsquo;t make changes they want to make to the program because they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to code. Even among programmers, one programmer might not have the expertise to modify a program to their liking or they might not be familiar with the programming language used. So unequipped developers and users rely on other developers to make the changes they desire. Without Freedom 3, only the original developer or group of developers is allowed to distribute modified versions of the program. In other words, the original developers retain a monopoly on modifications. They could charge any price for a requested feature. If they decide to stop maintaining the project, then other developers will be powerless to continue program maintenance. Freedom 3 is necessary to enable a healthy ecosystem of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">forks&lt;/a> to suit the needs of each type of user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the original developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a monopoly on modifications with Freedom 3, other developers can improve upon the code, add features they desire, remove features they don&amp;rsquo;t desire, and collaboratively contribute to the program. This is just not possible without Freedom 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="free-software-is-not-a-panacea">Free Software is not a Panacea&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the bare minimum of ethical standards for software, programs should be free software. Free software ensures that the social system around the software is just, that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>automatically&lt;/em> create unjust power differentials between developers and users and between developers and others developers that &lt;em>otherwise&lt;/em> wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there. Obviously if developer A is more skilled than developer B, developer A will be better able to modify the program to their liking. And obviously if user A is wealthy and wants feature X and user B isn&amp;rsquo;t wealthy and wants feature Y, then user A can pay developers to prioritize feature X over feature Y. Free software is not free from influence by corporate interests. The Mozilla Foundation wrote Firefox to use the Google search engine because Google funds Firefox development in return. Microsoft, the proprietary software giant, is on the Linux Foundation. Linus Torvalds has been responsible for big decisions in the mainline Linux kernel for decades. Free software doesn&amp;rsquo;t even mean development of software is democratic in practice. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent dictator for life&lt;/a> is the title given to free software developers that get the final say in development decisions. Since the &amp;ldquo;dictator&amp;rdquo; has the majority of development inertia behind them, any developer that might think of forking the software upon a development dispute would think twice since the inertia for the project already lies behind the dictator&amp;rsquo;s fork. Free software also doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be user friendly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have accessibility for those that speak foreign languages or the disabled. It can even be socially harmful and still qualify as free software. Some free software may require expensive hardware that only the wealthy can afford. Accessibility is limited to the rich in that case. Free software doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="still-use-it">Still, Use It&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Free software does not solve the problems I mentioned and it&amp;rsquo;s not meant to. The problems I described can possibly be avoided, with great care. With proprietary software, they are downright unavoidable. Proprietary software &lt;em>automatically&lt;/em> sets up an unjust social system around software. It&amp;rsquo;s a non-starter. Doomed before it even starts. There is no way to create proprietary software and have it be as ethical as free software because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet the basic requirements for a just social and economic system. It &lt;em>discourages&lt;/em> understanding, sharing, and collaboration. It&amp;rsquo;s no good. If you use proprietary software often, it becomes a habit. And when it becomes a habit, the developer of the software gains influence over you because they control the software you rely on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developers of proprietary software have a &lt;em>monetary incentive&lt;/em> to mistreat their users. Anti-features can be very profitable. They have no reason not to add anti-features since others can&amp;rsquo;t understand the compiled code and won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily even know about the anti-features and couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about them even if they did because they&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to modify the program. Proprietary programs are instruments of unjust control over the users. Proprietary software should not exist. It should all be eradicated and replaced with free software instead. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t tolerate it if you can at all help it. The best way you can help with the liberation of cyberspace is by switching to using as much free software as possible instead of the proprietary software you might currently be using. Free software is how we stay in control of our own computing. Without it, our devices will cease to be our own. The code we run on our devices will be under the control of developers with incentives to do us harm. We want the developers writing our software to have incentives to write software that only benefits us. If we refuse to use proprietary software and use free software instead, developers will see they can&amp;rsquo;t get away with not giving users their freedoms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the future I envision, developers will lose all incentive to write proprietary software knowing in advance no one will use it. It won&amp;rsquo;t even cross their minds as a possibility. Right now, getting people to switch to free software is a struggle. Many proprietary programs benefit heavily from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect&lt;/a>, keeping many people dependent. Free software is not even a well known social issue, &lt;em>yet&lt;/em>. But with enough awareness and with enough people using free software, the network effect will work in favor of a liberated cyberspace, not a divided, controlled, proprietary one. Computers become more integral to our way of life every day. Our devices have become extensions of ourselves. This is why it&amp;rsquo;s critical that they at least run free software. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way we can hope to trust them. Use as much free software as you can and spread the word to others. We need to take back our computing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Metaethics</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/metaethics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/metaethics/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about metaethics using the 3 questions posed by Bernard Rosen and Richard Garner. The first part is moral semantics. Moral semantics asks how we should interpret moral language, words like good, evil, right, wrong and ought. The next is moral ontology. Moral ontology asks about the nature of moral judgements. Are there many kinds of moral judgements? Are those judgements true for everyone or only specific groups? Lastly, there is moral epistemology. It talks about what we can &lt;em>know&lt;/em> about morality and how we know it, irrespective of its nature. For instance, how can we justify our moral judgements to others? I&amp;rsquo;ll start with moral semantics. Without defining the semantics, nothing else in this post would have any meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moral-semantics">Moral Semantics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are at least 2 desirable properties for our moral semantics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It should allow us to convince rational agents of our moral judgements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It should minimize the number of assumptions we have to make.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Theories such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism">emotivism&lt;/a> assert moral sentences just express emotions. When I say &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean &amp;ldquo;I dislike murder&amp;rdquo;. Neither does anyone I have ever met. We want more out of a moral theory than expressing emotions. We want to be able to convince others of our judgements. Emotivism isn&amp;rsquo;t what we&amp;rsquo;re after. What about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_prescriptivism">universal prescriptivism&lt;/a>? It holds that moral judgements such as &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; should be interpreted as &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t murder&amp;rdquo;. But just commanding someone to do something isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily convincing because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t employ logical reasoning. It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to convince anyone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t already believe they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be murdering. So again, it fails our first requirement of being able to convince others. Let&amp;rsquo;s move on to some other theories.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="humes-guillotine">Hume&amp;rsquo;s Guillotine&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_naturalism">Ethical naturalism&lt;/a> says that moral propositions are objective properties of the cosmos. This means that we can look at features of reality and &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; what is right and wrong in the same way that we can look into a microscope and deduce the germ theory of disease. This idea of moral semantics is self-evidently absurd. Making no extra assumptions, nothing about the way the world &lt;em>is&lt;/em> tells us the way it &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be. I cannot deduce &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; from empirical facts like &amp;ldquo;The sky is blue&amp;rdquo; or any other facts about the physical or metaphysical cosmos. This strict divide between facts and moral judgements is known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem">Hume&amp;rsquo;s Guillotine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_non-naturalism">Ethical non-naturalism&lt;/a> tries to bypass Hume&amp;rsquo;s Guillotine by saying that these moral judgements are &lt;em>irreducible&lt;/em>. Nothing about the way the cosmos &lt;em>is&lt;/em> tells us how it &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be, &lt;em>but&lt;/em> how things should be is an objective irreducible (possibly intuitive) property of the cosmos itself. If someone asks me &amp;ldquo;Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I murder?&amp;rdquo;, the only correct response according to ethical non-naturalism is philosophical jargon like &amp;ldquo;It is an irreducible, intrinsic property of the universe that murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;. If another ethical non-naturalist comes along saying murder is ethical, all I can do is repeat how my belief is an intrinsic property of the universe, so the other person must be mistaken. It would be like watching two &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presuppositional_apologetics">presuppositionalists&lt;/a> argue in circles. I&amp;rsquo;d be comfortable going on record saying presuppositional apologetics has never convinced anyone that didn&amp;rsquo;t already believe what it is they were presupposing. More like they already believed something and went looking for philosophical jargon to defend it. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what ethical non-naturalism does and also why it&amp;rsquo;s not convincing. Ethical non-naturalism fails both of our criteria because it is unconvincing to third-parties &lt;em>and&lt;/em> requires making assumptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any luck finding a moral semantics that satisfies both our requirements. What about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_command_theory">divine command theory&lt;/a>? According to it, god&amp;rsquo;s moral judgements are correct. There is no evidence that a god or gods exist, but let&amp;rsquo;s pretend for a moment that a god does exist &lt;em>and&lt;/em> that god makes moral judgements. According to divine command theory, god&amp;rsquo;s judgements are true. This raises the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_problem#The_dilemma">Euthyphro dilemma&lt;/a>: Are god&amp;rsquo;s moral judgements true just because god declares them, or are god&amp;rsquo;s moral judgements true because god only declares true moral judgements? If the former is true, then god can declare &amp;ldquo;Murder is perfectly morally okay&amp;rdquo; and it would be true because god said so and morality would be arbitrary. If the latter is true, then god is just the messenger for moral judgements that are true independent of god&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Therefore god would be arbitrary. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_observer_theory">Ideal observer theory&lt;/a> suffers from the same dilemma. Even if we ignore all of that, both theories still fail our second criteria. The assumption is that god or the ideal observer&amp;rsquo;s judgements are true. We want to avoid making strong assumptions, so these theories aren&amp;rsquo;t good either for our criteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="moral-progress">Moral Progress&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I want to define &amp;ldquo;moral progress&amp;rdquo; before I continue. Moral progress means just what is sounds like; that it is possible to go from a less ethical society or individual to a more ethical one. Certain moral theories don&amp;rsquo;t allow us to do this. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_theory">Error theory&lt;/a> says that all moral claims are false. This is an assumption &lt;em>and&lt;/em> it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us to convince rational agents of our moral judgements because all moral judgements are false. &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Murder is good&amp;rdquo; are both false under this theory. So it&amp;rsquo;s a non-starter. We can&amp;rsquo;t do anything useful with this theory. We can&amp;rsquo;t convince others, can&amp;rsquo;t reason, can&amp;rsquo;t make deductions, and never have any reason to change our minds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moral progress is also impossible under &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">moral relativism&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to draw a hard line between what constitutes a &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo;, but let&amp;rsquo;s ignore that for now. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a very clear idea of who belongs to which culture at what time. According to relativistic morality, what is good is defined as what the &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo; accepts as good. This group could be a single individual or a society. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the case of a single individual. If I am my own group, then whatever I believe is automatically correct &lt;em>because&lt;/em> I believe it. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;true for me&amp;rdquo; that murder is wrong. It may not be true for another person or group, but it is true for me. Morality is relative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this reasoning, I am &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> wrong. There is &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> a reason for me to change my mind about any moral judgement because I&amp;rsquo;m right by definition. I can&amp;rsquo;t convince other individuals because whatever they believe is &amp;ldquo;true for them&amp;rdquo;, so this theory fails our first criteria. With cultural relativism, the culture is the group, not the individual. So, it might be possible for an individual to be wrong if they disagree with their culture. This would mean that an abolitionist in a slave-owning culture would be morally wrong about slavery because the predominant culture is in favor of owning slaves. Also, if the culture decides slavery is wrong, then there are two interpretations that can be made of their previous support of owning slaves. The first interpretation is that the culture was wrong to think that slave-owning was just, and now they have the right belief. But according to cultural relativism, this would also be true in the reverse direction. Going from an abolitionist culture to a slave-owning one would also have to be considered moral progress, since the only metric by which moral judgements can be made is what the existing culture believes. The second interpretation is that the culture was never wrong. When the culture was in favor of slave owning, it was in fact good to own slaves for that culture. And when the culture was in favor of the abolition of slavery, then owning slaves was immoral for that culture. This would imply that moral judgements &lt;em>can&lt;/em> change over time, but moral progress never really happens. Moral progress aside, convincing other cultures of your culture&amp;rsquo;s moral judgements has no rational basis in cultural relativism. Furthermore, it assumes that the culture is always right, a very strong assumption that fails our second criteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="objective-morality">Objective Morality&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Other moral semantics define morality in different ways. For example, some define good to be that which maximizes the well-being of all conscious creatures and bad to be that which maximizes suffering. These objective moral semantics are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> relative to any individual or culture. They &lt;em>do&lt;/em> allow for moral progress and they have the benefit that they allow us to convince others of our moral judgements. For a contrived example, let&amp;rsquo;s say I believe that &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, but my interlocutor thinks that &amp;ldquo;Murder is good&amp;rdquo;. If we are both using the same definition of good (the maximization of well-being), then I can show that murder reduces well-being, empirically. I can show how it negatively affects the well-being of the family and friends of the victim and talk about the pain of being murdered and the loss of the possibility of future well-being for that person. To use my earlier example, I can point out how slave-owning societies have less well-being in total than those without slaves. Therefore an abolitionist culture would be morally superior according to my definition of good and going from a slave-owning culture to an abolitionist one would be moral progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The big problem with objective morality is it &lt;em>must&lt;/em> make at least one assumption about what &lt;em>ought&lt;/em> to be in order to bypass Hume&amp;rsquo;s Guillotine. With utilitarianism, I am assuming that maximizing well-being and minimizing suffering is what we&amp;rsquo;re after. I have to assume that to deduce that murder is wrong. Otherwise I can point out that murder reduces well-being all day long, but it won&amp;rsquo;t get me anywhere because good has nothing to do with well-being. So we are stuck with either not being able to reason about moral judgements with rational agents, or assuming that good has something to do with well-being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am levying the same criticism about popular moral philosophy that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant&lt;/a> did back in his day through my examples. Kant rightly realized that objective moral philosophy has the insurmountable problem that it &lt;em>must&lt;/em> rely on a &amp;ldquo;heavily subjective&amp;rdquo; moral imperative to get started. The earlier example I gave of well-being does not apply to people who only care about their own well-being. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarian">Utilitarianism&lt;/a> will never persuade moral action on behalf of those that only care about themselves. Therefore, objective morality can never surpass &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_imperative">hypothetical imperatives&lt;/a>. A hypothetical imperative only applies to someone who wishes to achieve certain ends. If I want to pass a test, I&amp;rsquo;d better study. Another way to say this is I &lt;em>only&lt;/em> need to study &lt;em>if&lt;/em> I want to pass the test. If I don&amp;rsquo;t care about passing, then I can study or not. It makes no difference. Kant saw this as inadequate and came up with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">categorical imperatives&lt;/a> instead. Categorical imperatives boil down to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(philosophy)">maxims&lt;/a> which also have to be assumed. So while Kant rightly criticized the objective morality of his day for making assumptions, he went on to create his own theory also based on assumptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="hypothetical-imperatives">Hypothetical Imperatives&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In a way, with this post, I am doing what Kant originally set out to do. He pointed out the same problems I see with objective morality and attempted to fix them. That is, existing moral systems all either require making some strong assumption &lt;em>or&lt;/em> they don&amp;rsquo;t make any assumptions but are useless when it comes to convincing rational agents of our moral judgements. But in doing so, he just made his own assumptions in the form of categorical imperatives. I am not going to do that. Kant&amp;rsquo;s categorical imperatives are unnecessary. Hypothetical imperatives are all that&amp;rsquo;s needed. Kant would have been right if he had just stopped after his criticism of objective morality and not tried to create his own Kantian morality. I do not need to assume my way around Hume&amp;rsquo;s Guillotine because I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make any assumptions. There&amp;rsquo;s no need for morality to go beyond hypothetical imperatives. I shall explain further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all have values. Values are things we care about. Some values are fundamental, meaning that we care about them in and of themselves. Others are instrumental. We care about them because they &amp;ldquo;derive&amp;rdquo; from other values. If I &lt;em>value&lt;/em> passing a test, then I &lt;em>ought&lt;/em> to study. Studying would be &lt;em>good&lt;/em>. In this case, studying is an instrumental value. I care about studying &lt;em>because&lt;/em> I care about passing the test. I care about passing the test because I care about passing the class. I care about passing the class because I care about graduating. I care about graduating because graduating increases my chances of getting a high-paying job. I care about getting a high-paying job because I care about having money. I care about having money because it increases my opportunities. I care about increasing my opportunities because increasing my opportunities increases my well-being. And I care about my well-being in and of itself. In that example, everything except well-being is an instrumental value. Well-being is the intrinsic value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does any of that matter? It matters because we can make certain assumptions about others' values. We can assume others generally value staying alive because evolution has baked that into all of us. Whether that is an intrinsic value or instrumental isn&amp;rsquo;t important. As long as others value their continued existence, we can convince them that they &lt;em>ought&lt;/em> to care about certain other instrumental values as well like having enough food to eat, having shelter, acting in a non-violent manner, etc. If we know someone&amp;rsquo;s values, we can reason with them about what other values they &lt;em>should&lt;/em> have, if they are rational. People often aren&amp;rsquo;t rational, meaning they often have instrumental values &lt;em>incompatible&lt;/em> with their intrinsic values. This is a fancy way of saying they don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s good for them. People can also be irrational by not doing what they know is good for them. It is common knowledge that a healthy diet and exercise is important, but we don&amp;rsquo;t always do that even though we all want to be healthy. While people aren&amp;rsquo;t always rational, I still consider it an important requirement of a moral system to be able to use rational arguments to convince others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hypothetical imperatives don&amp;rsquo;t make any assumptions because they are stated as conditionals. They also allow us to reason with other rational agents about moral judgements. The vast majority of the population values something like well-being for themselves and other conscious creatures. Therefore, I can deduce their other instrumental values if they are being rational. This allows us to collaborate on our values. It means we can tell someone &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; and they understand that to mean &amp;ldquo;Murder is in contradiction with one or more of my instrumental or intrinsic values&amp;rdquo;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to tell a psychopath that murder is wrong because they don&amp;rsquo;t value the well-being of others. This is a big problem in artificial intelligence. If a general artificial intelligence is created that is incompatible with our intrinsic human values, it could be extraordinarily dangerous. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis">orthogonality thesis&lt;/a> explains that any level of intelligence is compatible with any goal. This means a superintelligent AI smarter than we can imagine could value maximizing the number of peanuts in the universe above all else, including human life. It need not have human values which is what makes it so dangerous. It&amp;rsquo;s not that it&amp;rsquo;s bent on harming people. It&amp;rsquo;s just so bent on maximizing peanuts that it grinds humans up for resources to create peanuts. It is neutral toward our well-being because it only cares about peanuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aren&amp;rsquo;t going to convince psychopaths or AI systems to change their behavior by presenting them with moral theories. Hypothetical imperatives can explain why this is. Both the psychopath and the AI system do not share the same moral imperatives as most of humanity, so convincing them rationally is a lost cause. &lt;strong>We don&amp;rsquo;t lose anything by using only hypothetical imperatives&lt;/strong>. With rational agents that share our values, we can make convincing rational arguments. With rational agents that don&amp;rsquo;t share our values such as psychopaths or AI, we never had any hope of convincing them anyway. With irrational agents, we may be able to convince them, but not using rational argument. Therefore whatever we are doing to convince them can&amp;rsquo;t be considered moral reasoning, so we need not worry about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wrapping-up-moral-semantics">Wrapping Up Moral Semantics&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Returning back to our original question, how can we define words like good, evil, right, and wrong? Consider the fact that most of humanity shares the same values. In general, those values boil down to well-being for ourselves and others. So, the best way to understand a sentence like &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; might be &amp;ldquo;Murder is in contradiction with the instrumental or intrinsic values shared by nearly all of humanity&amp;rdquo;. There is an obvious objection to this. The objection is that some people just have different intrinsic values entirely. Psychopaths just don&amp;rsquo;t value the well-being of others intrinsically. A statement like &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; has no meaning to them. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a less extreme example. Person A values well-being so fervently that their ideal future looks like creating as many simulated beings as possible and flooding their minds with the utmost pleasure for the longest amount of time possible. Person A wants heaven on earth, literally. Person B on the other hand gets uncomfortable at the thought of utopia. Person B values variety, spicing things up a bit once in a while. They want to increase well-being also, but think that some suffering in the cosmos is appropriate. It&amp;rsquo;s what keeps us all human and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be completely gotten rid of. Person A and B both want increased well-being for themselves and others, but given a thousand years of arguing they could never come to a consensus on where exactly the peak of the moral landscape lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second less extreme scenario I gave with Person A and Person B is far more common I imagine than psychopaths or AI. True psychopaths are rare and we don&amp;rsquo;t have strong AGI yet. But every person you talk to probably pictures their version of heaven slightly differently. We want our moral language to be inclusive so we can convince others of our moral judgements, but everyone has slightly different intrinsic values. How can we reconcile this? My answer to this is simply that we don&amp;rsquo;t need to. In the same way that the rays of light from the sun hit earth in parallel because the sun is so far away, most people&amp;rsquo;s idea of utopia is far enough away from where we are now that the steps toward it are similar no matter what your idea of heaven is. Even if every person had radically different incompatible intrinsic values, the best thing we can do is try to find common instrumental values and work together on those. That is still the best option we have. So the only appropriate way to define moral language that I see is translating it into the language of hypothetical imperatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some may disagree, but I tend to be pragmatic. Language should be useful for communication. That&amp;rsquo;s where I get my first criteria for moral semantics. What good is moral language if we can&amp;rsquo;t use it to make rational arguments to convince others about our moral judgements? This is why I view theories like error theory, emotivism, and ethical non-naturalism as non-starters. They are not useful for convincing anybody of moral judgements and only serve to nullify moral language. Hypothetical imperatives are the most convincing way to interpret moral language such that extra assumptions are not necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moral-ontology">Moral Ontology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given that I am using hypothetical imperatives to interpret moral language, should moral statements be interpreted as universal or relative? When I say &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, how can that apply to others who do not value human well-being? They can&amp;rsquo;t exactly translate that to &amp;ldquo;Murder contradicts my instrumental or intrinsic values&amp;rdquo; if it in fact doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Does this mean everyone has their own morality and it&amp;rsquo;s all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">relative&lt;/a>? Or should we treat common intrinsic values as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism">universal&lt;/a> and even those that don&amp;rsquo;t value the well-being of others are subject to that moral judgement?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said before, we are far enough away from utopia that even if most of us don&amp;rsquo;t share the exact same intrinsic values, they converge on instrumental values. Therefore, as a matter of &lt;em>language&lt;/em>, it is best for us to talk as if everyone shares the value of well-being for themselves and others. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we universalize well-being into a global intrinsic value for everyone. Being a pragmatist, I care about convincing others of my values. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s really an important question if values are universal or relative. My answer to this would be interpret it however you want. Pragmatically, it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to affect your ability to convince anyone. I personally am going to talk in a universal way because it sounds more natural and gets the point across. I am going to say &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong, for me&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; applies to everyone that shares the intrinsic value of increasing well-being and decreasing suffering, which is almost all humanity. So, even though I know that not &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> has an intrinsic set of values that can deduce &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, I am going to &lt;em>speak&lt;/em> as if it&amp;rsquo;s a universal anyway because it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>close enough&lt;/em> that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to speak with exception. &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; is a good analogy. Murder is wrong, generally. But what about in wartime? What about in self-defense? It&amp;rsquo;s less clear. But despite that, we don&amp;rsquo;t say things like &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong except during wartime and except in self-defense and except&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. We don&amp;rsquo;t speak this way because the list of exceptions goes on forever. For the same reason, I am going to say &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; without considering all the edge cases like an AI that only values maximizing peanuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The short answer to the moral ontology of my metaethics is &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo;. You can treat it as relative or universal. It makes no difference to the hypothetical imperatives. Either someone shares your values and you can go about using rational argument to convince them or they don&amp;rsquo;t and you can&amp;rsquo;t. Whether you want to say &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo; is true for only people that value well-being or it&amp;rsquo;s true for everyone is a question I don&amp;rsquo;t think deserves an answer. It&amp;rsquo;s a question that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any meaning. Semantically, I think it makes the most sense to speak in universals (&amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong, for me&amp;rdquo;) and I&amp;rsquo;ve given my reasons why. With that, I&amp;rsquo;ll move on to the last section which is moral epistemology.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moral-epistemology">Moral Epistemology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we know how to interpret moral judgements, how can we actually support or defend moral judgements? Part of my motivation for writing this post is how much I enjoyed Sam Harris' book &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/">The Moral Landscape&lt;/a>. I highly recommend it. In it, he explains how scientific facts &lt;em>can&lt;/em> inform moral values. What many people take issue with is that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t really solve the is-ought problem. He just asserts that morality has something to do with the well-being of conscious creatures. I don&amp;rsquo;t take too much issue with this since it is almost universally true. I just avoid taking that step and instead use hypothetical imperatives to avoid running into the is-ought problem that is a &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLJGabZ6siFHoC6Nh/sam-harris-and-the-is-ought-gap">popular critique of his book&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bigger problem I see with Sam&amp;rsquo;s morality is one I brought up already. Even for those who do value well-being, there may be minute differences in the end goal those values imply. Some that value well-being may want a perfect utopia. Others that also value well-being may think that goes too far, that there should always be at least some discomfort to spice things up. Sam himself has admitted before that he finds the idea of a &amp;ldquo;well-being utopia&amp;rdquo; uncomfortable. His common response to criticisms of this sort is that the idea of well-being is fluid and continually evolving. However, this still doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem that some people, likely many people, just have irreconcilable intrinsic values, even if they all value well-being. For that reason, I choose not to assume that well-being is what everyone is after. This allows my theory to account for wide variances in value structures, but I understand why Sam starts with well-being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finished criticizing what I think Sam got wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what he got right in his book. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a quote from Sam&amp;rsquo;s book The Moral Landscape:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If our well-being depends upon the interaction between events in our brains and events in the world, and there are better and worse ways to secure it, then some cultures will tend to produce lives that are more worth living than others; some political persuasions will be more enlightened than others; and some world views will be mistaken in ways that cause needless human misery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>With this, we get a sense for how Sam thinks about how science can inform moral values (well-being). On this, I agree with him. He is pointing out that some ways of being produce more well-being than others. Some ways of living, some cultures, some political persuasions, some world views will tend to produce more well-being than others. And we can use science to discover which ways of doing things produces the most well-being for everyone, even given slight differences in the way individuals value well-being. If I go on for too long about science informing moral values, I will just be summarizing his book. Instead of that, I would recommend reading &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/">The Moral Landscape&lt;/a> to find out more. If you&amp;rsquo;re a busy person, you can listen to the audiobook instead. Reading is more active than listening and also allows you to go at your own pace, so I would just read it if you have time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the way Sam defines morality, the other value structures without well-being as an intrinsic value aren&amp;rsquo;t really relevant. With my semantics, they are. So I want to make a quick observation. Science can inform &lt;em>all&lt;/em> value structures, not only maximizing well-being and minimizing suffering. This includes non-human value structures such as maximizing peanuts. You can imagine an AI using the scientific method to find the optimal configuration of matter for producing peanuts. If maximizing peanuts is your only intrinsic value, then science can inform you on what you &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be doing to best accomplish that because some methods are going to produce more peanuts than other methods. This goes back to the hypothetical imperative. If you value maximizing peanuts, then you &lt;em>should&lt;/em> use peanut-production method A rather than method B. Other than that, I think Sam&amp;rsquo;s book does a great job at explaining how science can inform well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll start off by saying what this post is not. I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>not&lt;/em> going to give any thoughts on how to organize a blog. I&amp;rsquo;m also &lt;em>not&lt;/em> going to give any advice on blog topics, the technical details of running a blog on the web, etc. This post is more about what I believe to be good rules of thumb and things to keep in mind when running a blog. There are going to be exceptions and circumstances where my ideas don&amp;rsquo;t apply. But, on the whole, you should still consider the following if you run a blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="permanence">Permanence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you are writing a blog post that is published to the web, you should think carefully about what you want to say because it can be forever tied to your identity, unless your blog is anonymous. Even then, if you are ever deanonymized, your words can still be linked to you. Remember your blog posts can&amp;rsquo;t ever really be taken down. They can always be archived or saved by somebody before you decide to remove them. This is a good policy for anything you do on the internet in general. If you say something foolish, politically incorrect, something that would preclude you from future job opportunities or personally endanger you (depending on which country you live in), you should consider before publishing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not advocating for self-censorship. I&amp;rsquo;m also not advocating avoiding controversial subjects. Don&amp;rsquo;t be politically correct. Don&amp;rsquo;t avoid saying things just because people might get upset. After all, being offended is not an argument. Just keep in mind the potential consequences of writing about controversial topics. Those consequences may vary depending on where you live. If you live in Iran, the consequences of blogging about gay rights are going to be very different from what they are in western European countries. So don&amp;rsquo;t self-censor, but do be aware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all that said, it&amp;rsquo;s also true that the internet has made us less able to forgive. Memory plays a huge role in forgiveness. Before the internet and smartphones, when you did something foolish or said something regrettable, the people that saw or heard it would forget about it. The memory would fade away. Even if they shared your mistake with someone else, that someone couldn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;relive&amp;rdquo; the experience. It was just their recollection of events transmitted via spoken words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the internet, your mistakes are permanent. Anything you do or say can be recorded and stored forever, and you can never take it back. It&amp;rsquo;s also harder for others to forgive and forget because your mistake is digitally preserved in video, audio, text and other formats. It can be easily shared with an unlimited number of people. To see the full impact of this, all you have to do is look at the high-profile suicide of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd">Amanda Todd&lt;/a>. She was a 15-year old Canadian student that was cyberbullied with nude pictures of herself that got screen captured. Those pictures followed her ultimately driving her to suicide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-importance-of-forgiveness">The Importance of Forgiveness&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My point is, if someone says or does something regrettable and it gets digitally captured and put on the internet, whether or not they meant to upload it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to judge them by that forever. Amanda Todd is an extreme case and I&amp;rsquo;m not equivocating her suicide with intentionally publishing content in blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m just pointing out that the internet is an unforgiving place when it comes to making mistakes whether that is a mistake on your blog or leaked nude photos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People change. Opinions change. Levels of confidence in opinions change. Once information is shared on the internet such as a blog, it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible to remove it since things on the internet have to be treated as lasting forever. The only other option we have is to change our culture. We need to make an effort to be extra forgiving of things that we find online about others and not immediately jump to outrage or disgust as is so easy to do. Having a culture where one regrettable comment you made years ago can prevent you from finding employment is unhealthy. It can&amp;rsquo;t be a good thing psychologically to have past mistakes never stop haunting you as seen with Amanda Todd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have a responsibility while blogging to consider what you write carefully before you publish it and it&amp;rsquo;s out there forever. When you decide to blog, you &amp;ldquo;sign up&amp;rdquo; for your words to be out there forever. However, readers also carry a responsibility to remember that there is a regular human being behind that blog and humans sometimes make mistakes. Humans have bad days. Humans say things they don&amp;rsquo;t mean. It&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to forget all of that reading words on a screen. With everything I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far on my blog, I would be amazed if all of it was completely true and didn&amp;rsquo;t have any errors. However, I think the benefit of getting my ideas out there, for me, outweighs the negative of occasionally getting something very wrong and looking foolish. That&amp;rsquo;s just the risk you take on with a blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-looking-foolish">Not Looking Foolish&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You should still try to limit the number of mistakes you make on your blog. One way to avoid getting things wrong on your blog that is fairly obvious is just to do your research and check your sources before publishing. That should be a given for anyone writing an informational blog. If your blog is more about you personally, you have less to worry about because research isn&amp;rsquo;t needed. For whatever type of blog you write, it is universally a good thing to be clear-minded when you are writing. If you&amp;rsquo;re not, it can come out in the tone of your blog. Don&amp;rsquo;t blog while you are angry, upset, or exhausted. Give yourself an extra day or two just to proofread what you wrote and check it for typos, sanity, and accuracy. Have a friend proofread it too. Also, think over if you really want to make it public because, again, you have to regard it as permanent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="changing-your-mind">Changing Your Mind&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Even if you try your best to limit the number of mistakes you make, errors will slip in anyway. A common feature of honest intellectuals and good bloggers is an ability to admit past errors without hang up. If you write a post that isn&amp;rsquo;t true and later learn that it&amp;rsquo;s bad information, you can edit the original post or make a new post correcting your mistake. Crucially, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal for you to do that. In the intellectual world, we are all working to promote good ideas and get rid of bad ones. It&amp;rsquo;s wrong to think of changing one&amp;rsquo;s mind as being &amp;ldquo;wishy washy&amp;rdquo;. When you get new information that contradicts what you previously thought, changing your mind is the appropriate thing to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lead member of the United States Coronavirus Task Force &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci">Anthony Fauci&lt;/a> garnered criticism from the White House for telling people not to wear masks early on in the Coronavirus pandemic and various other &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo;. The criticism he received and continues to receive over his &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo; is absurd because at the time and context in which he made those &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo;, the information he had available was very limited and pointed to the same advice he was giving. So, the &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo; he is being accused of aren&amp;rsquo;t even mistakes. They were the right calls to make at the time. After receiving new information, he &amp;ldquo;updated&amp;rdquo; his advice to fit the new evidence about the virus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This shows that changing your mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you made an error. Maybe the information you posted on your blog was the best available information at the time and it just so happens that it got updated since you posted it. Since I wrote my post about &lt;a href="../../exposing-zoom/">Zoom&lt;/a> there has been news about it that I left out. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean what I wrote is wrong, just outdated. In a certain sense, everything you post will soon be outdated just because of how language evolves. To be a rational thinking person is to change your mind sometimes, so get used to the idea that it might happen in your blog. You are under no obligation to continue believing the same things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are my thoughts on blogging. I hope they are useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Will is Incoherent - Part 2</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/free-will-is-incoherent-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/free-will-is-incoherent-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="recap">Recap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read my &lt;a href="../../free-will-is-incoherent-part-1">part 1&lt;/a> post about why free will is incoherent, I recommend reading that before continuing. In it, I demonstrate that free will not only does not exist, but it is incoherent on many levels. To sum up, the cosmos is either deterministic or random. This leaves no room for the conventional notion of free will since neither determinism nor randomness get you free will. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to imagine a cosmos where free will does exist, and that&amp;rsquo;s not because of lack of imagination. Even worse than that, there is no self to which free will could be ascribed in the first place. So, it&amp;rsquo;s a deeply confused idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I want to do in this post is talk about the implications of those facts. I want to talk about how we can still hold others responsible knowing they don&amp;rsquo;t have free will, how we can justify a justice system and laws if people aren&amp;rsquo;t ultimately responsible for what they do, and how realizing free will does not exist opens the doors to compassion. Responsibility is a good starting point to introduce the other topics, so I will start there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we have no free will, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we just do nothing since our choices aren&amp;rsquo;t our own anyway? No. Because the choice to do nothing is itself not of your own free will. So you aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;escaping&amp;rdquo; your lack of free will by doing nothing. Besides, can you really just sit around and do nothing for the rest of your life? Should you just not resist bad urges then? Also no, because every time you successfully resisted bad urges like overeating, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t of your own free will either. But how can people be responsible without free will? In other words, if a thief or murderer literally could not have stopped themselves from thieving or murdering, then how can we fault them for it? To do so would be like faulting a falling rock that lands on someone for obeying gravity because it has the exact same degree of free will as people do; none. I have talked about responsibility before in my previous post &lt;a href="../../on-individual-responsibility">on individual responsibility&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how we should redefine responsibility. That&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of language and not really what this post is about. But, there are a few other things I can speak to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sam Harris gives the example of a brain tumor which I will reiterate here. A person has a tumor pressing against their brain causing a violent episode in which they commit murder. Let&amp;rsquo;s say they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have committed murder absent the tumor. Then the tumor is fully exculpatory of the murder. It was the tumor&amp;rsquo;s fault. The murderer couldn&amp;rsquo;t help that they grew a tumor and we can all pretty much agree on that. But what if there was no tumor? We know as a matter of physics that the moments that led up to the murder, specifically the states of the murderer&amp;rsquo;s brain, fully determined that a murder was going to happen. If we could see the full chain of prior causes starting at the birth of the murderer to their upbringing, the memes they were taught by their society and culture, their genetic predisposition, down to the way their brain grew, and the moments and thought processes that led up to the murder, we would have a very different intuition. Seeing the full chain of prior causes is as fully exculpatory as learning about the presence of a tumor. The only difference is a tumor is more obvious. We can see a tumor. We can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily see a chain of prior causes. Instead of feeling anger or hatred or whatever at this person, we would feel empathy because we could see how, moment by moment, they were inevitably pushed into murdering. If we swapped places with this person atom by atom, we would have done exactly as they had done, inevitably forced by the chain of causality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="compassion">Compassion&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One consequence of this is that &lt;strong>hating people no longer makes sense&lt;/strong>. Even people that committed unspeakable atrocities such as Hitler and Stalin can&amp;rsquo;t rationally be hated for what they did. I&amp;rsquo;m not defending them either. Pick any villains you like. They are as much a victim of the chain of causality as morally good people are. No one is responsible for the way they are, not in any ultimate sense. This also means that feelings of pride and shame don&amp;rsquo;t really have any merit either. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any more sense for you to be really proud of your successes than ashamed of your failures. Your successes &lt;em>and&lt;/em> failures are not of your own doing. How could they be? And besides, you are a constantly changing organism. So, it&amp;rsquo;s a legitimate question to ask if the continual process that is you is similar enough to how it was when it succeeded or failed to actually stake claim to past successes and failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This opens us up to feel more compassion for everyone, not just people we like. It&amp;rsquo;s precisely because we could have been in their shoes, that we could have been them in another life so to speak and done exactly as they did (if only we had their atoms) with no ability to choose otherwise, that we are able to cease judgement and feel compassion. This also explains why we feel more forgiving of our own mistakes than others' mistakes. We can see the full chain of prior causes through our memories. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the way I am because of my parents who raised me. And they are the way they are because of their parents etc. But my neighbor or friend or coworker who is a mess is like they are just because that&amp;rsquo;s how they are. With me, Adam committed the original sin and therefore nothing is my fault. With my neighbor/coworker/friend/person who cut me off in traffic though, it&amp;rsquo;s a different story. The buck just stops at them&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="justice">Justice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How can we justify throwing people in jails and prisons if they aren&amp;rsquo;t ultimately responsible for their actions? Simple. Society is better off that way. Being &amp;ldquo;tough on crime&amp;rdquo; is completely compatible with disbelief in free will. What doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense is punishment for the sake of it. Given what we now know about free will and how that corrects our idea of responsibility, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense at all to punish someone just for the sake of it. How does it make sense to punish someone for the sake of it when they literally could not have done anything else? Punishment should always be toward some end. Hopefully toward a constructive end like rehabilitation, rather than a destructive end like vengeance. Sadly, the (in)justice system in the United States (and many other countries) does not reflect our modern understanding of the brain or free will. That is to say it isn&amp;rsquo;t based on reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The philosophy of punishment for the sake of it, punishment because it is &amp;ldquo;deserved&amp;rdquo;, pervades the United States (in)justice system. One stated purpose of the (in)justice system is rehabilitation. But this is in stark contrast to how prisoners are actually treated. It is, frankly, absolutely disgusting how our society treats lawbreakers, especially felons, in and outside of jails and prisons. The punishment itself is only supposed to be separation from society to keep the public safe and rehabilitate the criminal. The justification should sound something like &amp;ldquo;We have to isolate you from the general public to rehabilitate you for your own good and everyone else&amp;rsquo;s. It&amp;rsquo;s for the best&amp;rdquo;. But we all know it goes far beyond that. As a felon in the United States, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a decent job or housing. We need to ask ourselves, how does this help with rehabilitation? How does telling someone they can&amp;rsquo;t vote because they committed a crime help reintegrate them? What is the rational, rehabilitative basis for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing">mandatory minimum sentencing&lt;/a>? Is it justice to make several million workers work for slave wages (a few dollars per day) because they previously committed a crime? In what universe does slave labor help rehabilitate incarcerated workers? What about the fact that prison food is often unhealthy and nutritionally inadequate for adults? How does that help? How does it help prisoners by throwing them into solitary confinement for sometimes years to the point where they become antisocial and lose communication skills? I could go on but you get the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way incarcerated people are treated in the United States demonstrates 3 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The (in)justice system does not reflect an understanding that free will is incoherent, but endorses it as &amp;ldquo;universal and persistent&amp;rdquo; foundation for our whole legal system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The (in)justice system fails to address the root psychological causes of recidivism &lt;em>and&lt;/em> actively makes recidivism worse through dehumanization and punishment for the sake of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The (in)justice system demonstrates a psychopathic lack of compassion for incarcerated individuals that shows many involved have no actual interest in rehabilitation, only a desire for vengeance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The most surprising of these for me is number 2. I understand there is a prison-industrial complex which focuses on making the rich richer rather than rehabilitating prisoners. With that in mind, there stills seems to be &lt;em>either&lt;/em> an extremely impoverished understanding and deep misunderstanding of criminal psychology by correctional officers, prison staff, and prison administrators who demonstrate their misunderstanding by egging on violence and needless suffering in prisons through policy and actions &lt;em>or&lt;/em> an almost psychopathic lack of empathy and compassion from a combination of personal callousness of the suffering of others or being in an extraordinarily toxic environment where rehabilitation is only a word on paper and not a philosophy permeating the prison system and the only goal is to get home safe, not help incarcerated people. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;s both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How incarcerated people are treated says more about our society than it does about those incarcerated. Take the death penalty for instance. By putting someone to death, we are essentially saying, &amp;ldquo;We have no idea how to help this person. We lack the knowledge or resources to sufficiently rehabilitate them, so we just have to make them not exist any more&amp;rdquo;. That says more about our competence as a society than it does about the incarcerated individuals. Every time someone is executed by capital punishment by the state, that is a failure of our society to be competent enough to help that person. The very act of capital punishment, or decades-long prison sentences, demonstrates that fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="we-can-do-better">We Can Do Better&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m big on evidence-based thinking. No amount of me preaching about how broken our (in)justice system is shows that we can in fact do better. I can say everything I have above, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just me preaching. So I want to briefly cover some examples of how Nordic prison philosophy is more effective at rehabilitation and why their data makes sense in the context of everything I&amp;rsquo;ve already said. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend watching the documentaries out there on the Nordic prison system. I like the one about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halden_Prison">Halden Prison&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norway has one of the world&amp;rsquo;s lowest recidivism rates sitting at 20% while over 50% of prisoners in the United States will be back in jail within three years of release (Deady, C. W. (2014, March). Incarceration and Recidivism: Lessons from Abroad. Retrieved August 22, 2020, from &lt;a href="https://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf)">https://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf)&lt;/a>. Norway has no death penalty and a maximum of 21 years in prison. Meanwhile the United States has 25% of the world&amp;rsquo;s prison population despite only having 5% of the world&amp;rsquo;s total population. Americans are incarcerated for much longer than people in other countries and for non-violent offenses that &lt;a href="https://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf">wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even lead to incarceration in other countries&lt;/a>. Here is a quote from Time Magazine in 2010:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Norwegians see the island (Bastoy prison) as the embodiment of their country&amp;rsquo;s long-standing penal philosophy: that traditional, repressive prisons do not work, and that treating prisoners humanely boosts their chances of reintegrating into society. (William Lee Adams, “Sentenced to Serving the Good Life in Norway,” Time, July 12, 2010. Accessed August 22, 2020, &lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2000920,00.html)">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2000920,00.html)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Who would have thought that treating human beings like human beings with a real interest in trying to help them would be the best thing for society? Halden prison in Norway allows prisoners to freely roam for up to 12 hours in a day while max security prisons in the United States allow comparatively very little &amp;ldquo;yard time&amp;rdquo; surrounded by electric fences, razor wire, and snipers. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly very sad and disappointing that the United States and many other countries fail to do better than that. In Halden prison, each inmate&amp;rsquo;s room is private containing a desk, fridge, kitchen, and television according to an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/31/410532066/in-norway-a-prison-built-on-second-chances">NPR article by Jeffrey Kofman&lt;/a>. Halden has no razor wire or snipers and is less overcrowded than max security facilities in the United States. In Halden, violence is extremely rare. And escape attempts are very rare also.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie. It&amp;rsquo;s not a big happy coincidence that Nordic prisons see better results. It makes psychological and social sense that they see better results given how they treat prisoners. Their philosophy is one of restorative justice, creating better neighbors and equipping inmates with the skills to be successful back out in society, not just throwing them in a cage for inordinate amounts of time and hoping they &amp;ldquo;learn their lesson&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying there is no place for punishment in prisons, but there is an excessive focus on punitive actions in American prisons that is &lt;em>directly&lt;/em> driven by the philosophy that free will exists and they &amp;ldquo;deserve&amp;rdquo; what they get. Watch prison documentaries and first-person accounts in America and other countries with a high recidivism rate and compare them to prison documentaries in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to watch some long-time prison officials take trips to the Norwegian facilities and even get emotional because they realize how broken our system really is and how they contribute to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-new-mindset">A New Mindset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The key to a new mindset about justice really is introducing the meme of no free will into society and rethinking our idea of responsibility. Our idea of responsibility &lt;em>cannot&lt;/em> include the idea that people are ultimately the &amp;ldquo;author&amp;rdquo; of their actions. We know that has to be false as a matter of physics &lt;em>and&lt;/em> philosophy. Once the incoherency of free will is understood and its implications for compassion and justice, that really pulls the rug out from under the justification for hate and retribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent a lot of time talking about the implications for justice. Not only in our personal lives is it important to cultivate compassion for conscious beings, but it is important for our institutions as well. Even if you are a completely selfish person, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to live in a society of healthy, compassionate and self-actualized people just for your own sake? Your environment affects you like you affect it and who is in your environment affects you. If a segment of our population is suffering, that is not only that segment&amp;rsquo;s problem. That is everyone&amp;rsquo;s problem because we are not all isolated little egos separate from one another. While there isn&amp;rsquo;t always something you can do to help others, that does not mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t practice compassion for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to propose a principle of &lt;strong>radical universal compassion&lt;/strong> toward all conscious beings. One of the most important things we can do is find ways to practice compassion toward those that have wronged us and toward ourselves for our own past transgressions against others. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you ought never to feel bad about having wronged someone. But continuing to beat yourself up is not useful. Some people are toxic and you should avoid associating with them. But holding on to negative emotions, continuing to feel angry or guilty isn&amp;rsquo;t useful. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel good either. Holding a grudge harms you more than the person against whom you hold the grudge. Holding a grudge is akin to the thought process &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s important that I stay angry at this person for much longer than the normal half-life of my anger because they&amp;rsquo;ve done something so unforgiveable&amp;rdquo;. While you may cut ties with someone for compassion toward yourself, the hanging on to negative emotions is more harmful to yourself than to them. It&amp;rsquo;s like picking up a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else. You are the only one that gets burned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By realizing that no one is ultimately responsible for what they do, we open the doors to compassion. A person has exactly as much free will as a rock, and therefore holds as much ultimate responsibility for their actions as a rock does for falling on someone. You may object that humans are not like rocks. Humans have a nervous system and rocks don&amp;rsquo;t. Humans know what they are doing, even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>ultimately&lt;/em> responsible. If a person commits a murder, we can conclude they are more likely perpetrate violence in the future. If a rock falls on someone, we can&amp;rsquo;t conclude the same rock will fall on someone again just because it did so once before. What I&amp;rsquo;m saying is rocks and brains have the same degree of free will. In that respect, they &lt;em>are&lt;/em> the same. So it makes no more sense to blame a brain for planning a murder than it does to blame a rock for falling on someone. Develop a justice system that deters future violence and promotes better patterns of thought and behavior in brains? Absolutely. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t what is happening in America&amp;rsquo;s justice system and many others and the minds of many citizens. Blame is what is happening. Vengeance is what is happening. Needless suffering is what is happening. And that can&amp;rsquo;t be justified given a lack of free will. The guiding principle that does make sense in a justice system is &lt;strong>compassion&lt;/strong>, and the results from Nordic prisons bears that out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ego Traps</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/ego-traps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/ego-traps/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-ego">The Ego&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before I get into ego traps, I need to explain what the ego is. I made a post previously about &lt;a href="../../the-self">the self&lt;/a>. But, for this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a simple definition. Ego is the sensation of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. Ego is &lt;em>your idea&lt;/em> of yourself. When asked to describe yourself, the ego is what you&amp;rsquo;re describing. The ego is your &amp;ldquo;persona&amp;rdquo; that you display not only to others, but that you yourself believe. It&amp;rsquo;s incomplete. This has to be true because consciousness can never be an object of itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice that I don&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s inaccurate, just incomplete. You can never know exactly who you are. This is because, as far as we know, systems can&amp;rsquo;t simulate themselves. It always leads to infinite regression. Let&amp;rsquo;s use a computer system as a thought experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thought-experiment">Thought Experiment&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to build a computer system which perfectly simulates the universe. I mean the exact state and location of every atom, every gravitational wave, etc. We won&amp;rsquo;t concern ourselves about practicalities like speed, power draw, the limits of physics, or how it gets the initial state of the universe. We are going to ignore quantum randomness and locality issues like quantum entanglement. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are other quirks of physics I don&amp;rsquo;t know about, but we are going to ignore all of those and assume the universe is far more Newtonian than it is. The point of this experiment doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on the actual universe being Newtonian. It&amp;rsquo;s just to demonstrate a point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our computer system will be located on earth. Picture an imaginary sphere around our galaxy. Outside of this sphere is what our computer simulates. It ignores the inside. The simulation gets inaccurate over time because the part which it isn&amp;rsquo;t simulating (our galaxy) propogates light out at the speed of light away from us, affecting the simulation. But, since we are good system designers, we account for this. We program it so that the imaginary sphere automatically expands at the speed of light (the fastest information can travel in our universe). This means that the system does not try to simulate the slowly, ever-expanding sphere (our galaxy) in which it resides. We now have a perfectly accurate simulation of the universe, minus a relatively small expanding sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is working fine, so let&amp;rsquo;s upgrade the system. Now, it simulates the whole universe minus earth. We use the same solution as before, making an expanding sphere around the earth which it ignores. It will only take 8 minutes until that sphere touches the sun and we can no longer simulate the sun. Soon enough, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to simulate the solar system either, and it just gets worse from there. So, we upgrade the system again. Now, it simulates a sphere outside the building in which it sits. In no time flat, we already can&amp;rsquo;t simulate the earth any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How small can we shrink this sphere? The smallest we can make it is if our initial non-simulated volume is coterminous with the outline of our computer system. Perhaps we can even shrink it smaller if our system is very large and some parts don&amp;rsquo;t come online immediately. But we can never create a perfect simulation with this strategy because we can&amp;rsquo;t shrink the non-simulated area to zero. If we try to simulate the inside of our imaginary volume, then we get an infinite regression. If a system simulates itself, then it has to simulate the simulation of itself. And so on to infinity. Maybe this is somehow possible, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="returning-to-the-ego">Returning to the Ego&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The brain is a kind of computer. Like the system described in the thought experiment above, the brain also has a model of itself. Some people know themselves very well and their model is very good, others seem to have no self-awareness at all. But no one can have a complete model of who they are. Therefore, you always have a mysterious element to yourself. I wanted to use a thought experiment to make the problem clear, but Alan Watts explained this idea in terms of a set of simpler analogies which advocate the same idea:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;You cannot touch the tip of this finger with the tip of this finger&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using the term &amp;ldquo;model of oneself&amp;rdquo; very loosely. Obviously we don&amp;rsquo;t have to simulate all our neurons to know things about ourselves. There are other meaningful mental representations that we use to understand ourselves, such as the labels others give us. Yogis that spend years in caves can be compared to a system where the &amp;ldquo;sphere&amp;rdquo; of unawareness is kept very small. Yogis are some of the most self-aware members of our species in a manner of speaking. And humans are already the most self-aware species on earth. At the other end of the spectrum you have orangutans, chimps and gorillas. Some can pass the &amp;ldquo;mirror test&amp;rdquo;, the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. They are less self-aware, but the capacity is still there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ego-traps">Ego Traps&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Assuming a high level of awareness is desirable, and I believe it is for almost everyone, there are some things to watch out for. They are called &amp;ldquo;ego traps&amp;rdquo;. What they do is they take you from an aware and alert state of consciousness in touch with reality to one that is spellbound by thoughts, hardly perceiving the world around you. Perhaps only perceiving it enough not to bump into things. One thought after another, oftentimes negative and unproductive, with no ability to stop their steady flow. Ego traps are the &amp;ldquo;gateway thoughts&amp;rdquo; that get you started in this insane state of mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ego traps which everyone talks about are thoughts in the form of words. That&amp;rsquo;s because words are all language allows us to use and everything else is simply referenced by the words. But keep in mind anything that is in consciousness can be an ego trap. The nature of each person&amp;rsquo;s mind is different, so the ego traps they fall for are different. I just want to explicitly list a few common ones because once you get an idea of what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, it&amp;rsquo;s easier not to be fooled. Here are a few:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Feeling superior or inferior to others.&lt;br>
Thinking you are enlightened.&lt;br>
Wanting to be perfectly safe and secure.&lt;br>
Always desiring happiness.&lt;br>
Thinking there is something missing in your life and chasing after it.&lt;br>
Needing to always be right.&lt;br>
Trying to control how other people act.&lt;br>
Needing the approval of someone else or society.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I want to be clear that I&amp;rsquo;m not saying these desires are wrong to have or that myself and others who write about spirituality never have them. I&amp;rsquo;m saying they are often a gateway into a false sense of identity; your egoic identity. So, to be more aware, watch out for these thoughts. They can often enter in through the back door without you noticing, kicking off a chain reaction of other thoughts which create a grand myth. The ego likes to make up a grand cohesive story about who you are and it hopes you&amp;rsquo;ll buy into it. The more you think about it and feed into its narrative, the more you identify with that story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does this work? It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. All that I have listed basically boils down to a feeling of something being missing in your life. If you pursue the approval of others, then you subconsciously think that you must &lt;strong>need&lt;/strong> the approval of others. The harder you pursue others' approval, the more you feel you must need it. Otherwise, why would you be pursuing it, right? This is the rationalization your mind creates. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that every instance of trying to gain someone&amp;rsquo;s approval is bad or you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try. I&amp;rsquo;m saying be aware of those thoughts. If you want to be aware, don&amp;rsquo;t pursue the approval of others without knowing that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your sensation of identity takes the form of the thoughts you don&amp;rsquo;t know you&amp;rsquo;re having. The harder you pursue happiness, the more you will feel like you lack it. The more you always need to be right, the more you worry that you&amp;rsquo;re not. The more you want to be safe and secure, the less safe and secure you will feel. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to have desires. The desire to eat and continue living is necessary for survival. Just be aware of desire. Without the awareness, you take on a false sense of identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hide-and-go-seek">Hide and Go Seek&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The fundamental &lt;em>game&lt;/em> of being is like the game of hide and go seek. We hide in the thoughts we don&amp;rsquo;t know we&amp;rsquo;re having. They become who we are. Then one day, something or someone wakes us up and we realize we were playing a game the entire time. This could take 10 seconds or 10 years depending on the person. But, the game goes on several times in a single human life, played out in a different way each time. Just imagine all the ways the game is being played across all of humanity. The game of being a good person and not an evil one. The game of seeking happiness. The game of seeking enlightenment. The game of chasing after something. The game of pretending things are serious, that you&amp;rsquo;re not even playing a game. That&amp;rsquo;s why we find the joker character so fascinating. He plays devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. While everyone is taking life deadly serious, he dares to treat it like a game. The Christian religion is an absolutely marvelous game. The stakes of the game are eternal bliss versus eternal damnation. Christianity is the version of the game taken to the extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t publish this because I&amp;rsquo;m giving away a secret. I&amp;rsquo;m spoiling your opportunity to find out what it&amp;rsquo;s all about on your own. As Alan Watts says, I&amp;rsquo;ve given the show away. The main idea I want to get across in this post is that if you want to stop playing &amp;ldquo;hide and go seek&amp;rdquo;, if you want to stay found for a while, then you need awareness. And ego traps are the thoughts that pull you out of awareness, so watch out for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Will is Incoherent - Part 1</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/free-will-is-incoherent-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/free-will-is-incoherent-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you read what I have to write about free will, you should know that I agree fully with what &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/the-illusion-of-free-will/">Sam Harris&lt;/a> has written on the subject. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to be reiterating things he has said in my own words with some of my own observations. So if you are familiar with his words on the topic, I recommend skipping this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-free-will">What is Free Will?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For me to explain why free will is incoherent, I must first define it. The definition I am using is this: &lt;em>Free will is the capacity for conscious agents to do otherwise&lt;/em>. For example, I ate vanilla ice cream. I &lt;em>could have&lt;/em> eaten chocolate instead, or so it seems. This is the definition most closely aligned with what people understand free will to mean and the first one you will find on the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="knock-down-argument">Knock Down Argument&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m going to come at free will as I have defined it from several perspectives. First, I want to present a knock down argument against it. Usually, there are two sides to an issue or at least some gray area. But with free will, this is not so. Any fool can easily see it makes no sense even with a basic understanding of physics or logic. The argument against free will goes like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Word form:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The cosmos is either deterministic or random.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the cosmos is deterministic, there is no free will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the cosmos is random, there is no free will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, there is no free will.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Symbolic form:&lt;br>
D = The cosmos is deterministic.&lt;br>
F = Free will exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>D -&amp;gt; ~F (True premise)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>~D -&amp;gt; ~F (True premise)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>F (premise)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>~D (Modus tollens 1 3)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>D (Modus tollens 2 3)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Contradiction (4 5)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Therefore, premise 3 is false. Free will does not exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="justifying-premises">Justifying Premises&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I should justify how I know premise 1 and 2 are true. For numbering reference, I&amp;rsquo;m using the symbolic form of the argument, not the word form. So, let me start with premise 1. If the cosmos is deterministic, then free will does not exist. Imagine watching a movie. If you rewind the movie and replay the scene, the same events happen. If you rewind the movie a hundred times and replay it, you are going to see the same show. If the cosmos is like this, then where is your free will? You would be no more free to choose than the character in a movie you watch. That is to say, if it makes sense to &amp;ldquo;rewind the cosmos&amp;rdquo;, then the exact same events are going to happen at the same time in the same order the exact same way. This is incompatible with the popular conception of free will because with free will, you may make a different choice, changing the course of events from that point forward. If the cosmos is deterministic, then everything that was ever going to happen from the beginning of the cosmos until now was determined the moment it began. The atoms that make up your brain and the quarks that make up the atoms, at bottom, behave deterministically. If the cosmos is deterministic, you definitely could not have &amp;ldquo;done otherwise&amp;rdquo;, since it was predetermined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now on to premise two. If the cosmos is not deterministic, then free will does not exist. I&amp;rsquo;m going to substitute &amp;ldquo;not deterministic&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo;, since they are equivalent by definition. If the cosmos is random, then free will does not exist. Imagine you are choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream. You assign chocolate to heads and vanilla as tails on a coin. Then you flip a fair coin. It lands heads, so you eat chocolate ice cream. Did you choose to eat chocolate? Of course not. If you rewind that moment 100 times and if the coin is truly random, then chances are you will eat chocolate around 50 times and vanilla 50 times. But in no sense did you choose. Sure you can &amp;ldquo;do otherwise&amp;rdquo; in the superficial sense, but no one would say they &lt;em>chose&lt;/em> to eat that flavor. So that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be counted. Although it sounds like it satisfies the technical definition of free will, it&amp;rsquo;s not what anyone means by the term. I need to point out that a coin flip is a bad example. Coin flips are very deterministic because coins are such huge objects compared to atoms and quarks. Quantum mechanics tells us, among many things, that the cosmos has true randomness. I say &amp;ldquo;true randomness&amp;rdquo; because a coin flip isn&amp;rsquo;t truly random. If you know the initial condition of the coin and the airflow of the room and its initial velocity all perfectly, then you can predict which side the coin will land on before it lands. That&amp;rsquo;s not true randomness. I only used it as an analogy because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to talk about than quantum mechanics, but my argument still holds true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It follows therefore that free will does not exist. Note that I use the word &amp;ldquo;cosmos&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;universe&amp;rdquo; in my argument to include &amp;ldquo;all that is&amp;rdquo;. That includes souls if you believe you have one, god or gods, alternate dimensions, nonphysical reality, magic, etc. My argument remains the same for whatever you might want to throw in, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing extra you can add that will make free will exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="but-i-feel-free">But I feel free!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you pay close enough attention to the process of making a decision, what your brain is doing, then you will clearly see you have no idea where your decisions come from. From the perspective of your conscious mind, your decisions seem to pop right out of the void. You are in no position to say where your decisions come from or why you did what you did. Studies have repeatedly beared this out. The reasons people give for the decisions they make do not align with the actual reasons. Sam Harris referenced an experiment where participants are given hot coffee versus cold coffee before a decision is made, and those two groups of hot and cold participants will make different decisions on average. But they never say it was the temperature of the coffee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even without any outside influence, you didn&amp;rsquo;t wire your brain. You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose your upbringing. You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose your parents or genes which we know influence how impulsive you are, how neurotic, and other factors. There is a continuous chain of causality (which you didn&amp;rsquo;t choose) that led up to this moment. Pay attention to your breath going in and out for just 30 seconds and wait for your next thought. Where did that thought come from? How can you have free will if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the next thing that you&amp;rsquo;re going to think? Your mind is not under your own control. If it was, then part of it would be doing the controlling and the other part controlled. But the part that is doing the controlling is not under control by definition. This invites an infinite regression of who is controlling the controller. The buck has to stop somewhere. Even if you did wire your own brain, that would invite an infinite regression again. Did you wire the part that did the wiring? This is all assuming it even makes sense to talk about your brain as two logically distinct separate entities. Even the sense of having free will is a feeling you did not yourself manufacture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to show is that you are not the thinker of your thoughts. In general, we feel that we &lt;em>have&lt;/em> thoughts. And that there is a separate us that is thinking them. This is not so. There is no separate thinker of your thoughts. The feeling of there being a thinker of your thoughts is itself a sensation in consciousness. The sensation of there being a &amp;ldquo;decider&amp;rdquo; of your decisions is just itself a sensation. Not only do you not have free will, but there is no self, no ego, no decider that could possibly make decisions in the first place. There are only decisions. The problem is the word decisions implies a decider, so it&amp;rsquo;s a loaded word that I have to labor under to get my point across.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you still &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> free, all I can do is invite you to look closer at your own decision making process going on inside your head. But it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see that you&amp;rsquo;re not &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; your decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="incoherent">Incoherent&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I say free will is incoherent, what I mean is it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to conceive of a cosmos in which free will does exist. My knock down argument only shows that free will does not exist, not that it&amp;rsquo;s incoherent. In truth, it&amp;rsquo;s an awkward argument to make. One could debate the semantics of proving the nonexistence of an incoherent concept, but my argument gets my point across anyhow. For example, the idea of fairies is at least coherent. That is, it&amp;rsquo;s at least possible to imagine a cosmos in which they exist, even though we know there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence for them. The same cannot be said about free will, no matter how good your imagination is. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to show that something is incoherent because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to show. It&amp;rsquo;s really on the burden of those supporting it to prove that it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> coherent. And if they are unable, my work is done. I&amp;rsquo;ll give an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you ask someone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t philosophize all day long what free will is, they might tell you it&amp;rsquo;s the ability to choose. But what does it mean to make a choice? The problem has been pushed back a step because now we have to define what a choice is. If you ask them again, &amp;ldquo;What is a choice?&amp;rdquo;, they may respond saying it&amp;rsquo;s a decision. And then you can ask &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get very precise here since it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> philosophy after all. What &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> is a decision&amp;rdquo;? And you can go on and on like this. The problem is any time they use the word &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;decision&amp;rdquo;, they are unknowingly sneaking in free will. Anecdotally, I have never had someone give me a satisfactory explanation to that inquiry. It was always replacing &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;decision&amp;rdquo; or vice versa. I never did get to the bottom of it and it&amp;rsquo;s always the same conversation. This leads one to believe that free will isn&amp;rsquo;t really concrete at all. It&amp;rsquo;s a vague idea that people think they understand. But when challenged, they can&amp;rsquo;t explain what it physically means.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compatibilism">Compatibilism&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a philosophical position called compatibilism which I should mention. Not everyone uses the same definition of free will as I have used in my argument. Compatibilists claim that free will is compatible with determinism by redefining the term &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t really consider this worth arguing against since no one thinks of or uses the word free will in that sense. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant&lt;/a> called it &amp;ldquo;word jugglery&amp;rdquo; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James&lt;/a> pejoratively referred to it as &amp;ldquo;soft determinism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our cosmos as we currently understand it isn&amp;rsquo;t even deterministic, so the compatibilist also has to claim that a random cosmos is compatible with free will as well. This means a cosmos which is, at bottom, behaving in a random fashion somehow gives you free will. Free will also can&amp;rsquo;t be an emergent property of determinism or randomness, so the compatibilist position is just a failed attempt at redefining common parlance to win an argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have shown that free will is an incoherent idea and addressed some common arguments in favor of it. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to despair after reading this post. In the next and final post, I want to show that the lack of free will is not something to despair about. It can actually be a source of compassion. It has important implications for how we think about responsibility as I have hinted at in my &lt;a href="../../on-individual-responsibility">past post&lt;/a> on individual responsibility. It has huge implications for the US criminal justice system. I would suggest collecting some thoughts of your own and drawing your own conclusions about what this means for our society as an exercise before you go on to read the next part. It does take me a lot of work to put these ideas out expressed in a clear way.

&lt;p>As a quick note, what people post online is often taken as something they will forever agree with and are forever held to. This is unreasonable. There needs to be some equivalent of forgiveness if one posts something horrible online, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying people aren&amp;rsquo;t responsible for what they post. But I am saying we should aspire to take the most charitable interpretation of what people post if we care about advancing the conversation. Obviously a person&amp;rsquo;s character is a factor in how you interpret what they post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my blog, I want to retain the right to post not only ideas that I understand well. But I also want the freedom to talk about things I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about. That means I run the risk of being wrong. No one posting their ideas online openly should expect to be immune to criticism. Criticism comes with the territory. But I want to say I&amp;rsquo;m interested in sharing ideas. If it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me you&amp;rsquo;re only interested in taking my words out of context, twisting what I write or using cheap gotcha&amp;rsquo;s because I didn&amp;rsquo;t state something perfectly, then I probably won&amp;rsquo;t respond.

With that cleared up, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the meat of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="caring-what-others-think">Caring What Others Think&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most people are going around supremely concerned with what other people think of them. People convince themselves they don&amp;rsquo;t care about what others think, almost as a badge of honor. If someone tells you this, express disbelief as a test. If they insist they don&amp;rsquo;t care, then you might say they care enough about what you think to try to convince you that they don&amp;rsquo;t. If I get any emails from people who insist they don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably find it funny because it only serves to further my point. Humans are social animals. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty well baked into all of us to be concerned with what other people think. Our brains have the capacity for theory of mind not by accident. It keeps us all in check so to speak. This is especially true if you&amp;rsquo;re around a lot of people, in a densely populated city like NYC for example. You literally have less room to think without the input of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="meeting-expectations">Meeting Expectations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is no shortage of outside influences telling us how we ought to think, feel, and behave. In Japan, due to the influence of social conformity, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting">tiger parenting&lt;/a> and strict societal expectations to perpetual the status quo, there are over a million &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">hikikomoris&lt;/a> in Japan. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, a hikikomori is a reclusive person who undergoes self-isolation for extended periods of time. This could be months or years even. There are surely other contributing factors to hikikomoris such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori#Psychiatric_disorders">psychiatric disorders&lt;/a>, but I want to focus on social conformity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an extremely socially conformist culture where differences are not well-tolerated, is it any surprise that young Japanese are rejecting it, opting to live in isolation? Japanese children are often being crushed under the weight of parent&amp;rsquo;s and peer&amp;rsquo;s expectations, especially in education. Some hikikomoris attended &amp;ldquo;cram schools&amp;rdquo;, or juku. Ikuo Amano, professor of Sociology at the University of Tokyo said &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not healthy for kids to have so little free time. It is not healthy to become completely caught up in competition and status at such a young age&amp;rdquo;. In some cases in cram schools, Japanese children spend almost all their waking hours short of basic biological needs cramming. This is not good for their emotional or physical well-being. It&amp;rsquo;s not allowing enough room for the individual to flourish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="feeling-the-right-way">Feeling the Right Way&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="mens-feelings">Men&amp;rsquo;s Feelings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have to add a disclaimer that not everyone is ready to face their repressed emotions head on. For example, veterans suffering from PTSD should &lt;em>not&lt;/em> try to revisit the bad memories alone. That is where the role of a therapist comes in. They can gently guide you to facing your fears, in a professional setting. This goes for anyone who faces emotional trauma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how true this is across different cultures, so I&amp;rsquo;ll speak on behalf of my own. There is something very misguided that young men are still taught in the US. I see the situation improving. Younger generations are becoming more aware of this, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a very present part of American culture. There is a taboo against boys and men displaying any negative emotion, except anger or maybe dissatisfaction. Displaying upset, sadness, depression, or anxiety is &amp;ldquo;unmanly&amp;rdquo;. Men talking to each other about their feelings is very taboo in our culture still. We have the phrase &amp;ldquo;man up&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know men don&amp;rsquo;t cry? Men don&amp;rsquo;t complain. Be a man. This is a dangerous thing to impart to young boys because bottled up emotions end up coming out somehow. And better to have emotions coming out through tears than self-destructive habits or violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a huge pressure on men not to display emotions, to outright pretend their emotions don&amp;rsquo;t even exist, and to never talk about their problems. And it would serve us all well to change that extremely toxic part of our culture. There will be men who read and agree, yet &lt;em>&lt;strong>still&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> won&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable showing emotions because it&amp;rsquo;s ingrained in the culture. You will be judged by other men for showing emotions. You might even lose your &amp;ldquo;man card&amp;rdquo;, respect from other men in the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is this strange idea given to us by society which is this: If you show your emotions, if you cry, if you get upset and display it, then you aren&amp;rsquo;t in control. You don&amp;rsquo;t have a lid on it. This is completely backwards. In fact, the &lt;em>only&lt;/em> way to manage so called negative feelings is to not push them away. It&amp;rsquo;s to allow yourself to feel them. By pushing negative emotions away, you push away a part of yourself. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying one should dwell on negative events in one&amp;rsquo;s life. But if they keep coming up in your mind, don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily push them away. If you distract yourself from them, you might succeed temporarily in not dealing with how you feel. But if you always do that and never face yourself, it will degrade your mental stability and your quality of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="being-happy">Being Happy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Besides the taboo against men&amp;rsquo;s emotions, there is also a taboo that applies to everyone. It is the taboo against being sad. I have to add another disclaimer here that I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about someone that is severely depressed. People with depression should get professional help. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to give advice that treats or cures mental illness. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t seek out what makes them happy in life. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the natural state of every person of being sad sometimes. No one is happy all the time. In my experience, most people are vaguely discontent most of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is pushed on people by society that they ought to never be sad or anxious. Cheer up, don&amp;rsquo;t be a negative nancy, don&amp;rsquo;t be a party pooper, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, be happy, don&amp;rsquo;t be mad, and just relax. This is a form of doublethink. It is commanding someone to do something that can&amp;rsquo;t be forced. It&amp;rsquo;s as if you told someone to grow their hair faster, or beat their heart faster. If you pay very close attention, the physical sensations of stress and happiness have a very similar profile. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sensation of sadness itself that&amp;rsquo;s so bad. It&amp;rsquo;s what we think it means, because society has told us that it&amp;rsquo;s not a good thing to be sad. Why not? It&amp;rsquo;s a necessary emotion that healthy people feel sometimes. Why not be content being sad? It&amp;rsquo;s not the sensation of sadness that causes suffering. That&amp;rsquo;s a myth. It&amp;rsquo;s the aversion to sadness that causes the suffering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a message that is more often implicitly than explicitly pushed on us. You don&amp;rsquo;t see sad people in advertisements. Everyone is always smiling. If you just buy this product, you&amp;rsquo;ll be as happy as those in the advertisement! Except that never happens. The nature of the mind is to invent a new obstacle as soon as you overcome the current one. In the US, food service workers are expected to produce a fake smile and be overly kind to customers, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not genuine. &amp;ldquo;Service with a smile&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;enjoy your meal&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Thank you for calling &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. I tune out when I hear these phrases because I know they&amp;rsquo;re just socially mandated platitudes. It&amp;rsquo;s a very sick thing about our culture that we are always expecting happiness. There needs to be more room to express sadness and discontent. Maybe if there was, we would have less food service workers spitting in people&amp;rsquo;s food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lesson here is if you allow yourself to feel how you actually feel, instead of how you&amp;rsquo;ve been told you are supposed to feel, you&amp;rsquo;ll be in a much better position to manage your emotions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="being-a-good-person">Being a Good Person&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Society teaches us we have to be a good person. Do the right thing. Be kind to others. While being kind to others is useful if you have the same instrumental goals as the vast majority of the human species, that is goals that further other instrumental or ultimate goals, it is not useful for those who don&amp;rsquo;t share those goals. It&amp;rsquo;s just a mantra for them. If you share top goals that are typically associated with being a &lt;em>good&lt;/em> person such as prosperity of the human race and other species and eliminating needless suffering, then you will naturally try to promote &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. If deep down, you sincerely don&amp;rsquo;t care about anyone else at all and never will, you may be a psychopath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Society has taught as that being a psychopath is a very bad thing to be. It has a highly negative connotation. We tend to avoid associating with people we recognize as psychopaths since they are incapable of empathy or remorse. While genuine psychopaths are very rare, many completely neurologically typical people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like to see others succeed. They have particular people that they don&amp;rsquo;t feel compassion or remorse for, that they hold a grudge against, and they come by that honestly. The families of Ted Bundy&amp;rsquo;s victims probably felt great relief to see him electrocuted to death. This comes from a feeling of wanting revenge, not out of compassion. The compassionate view is that unfortunately someone whose values are incompatible with society ended up causing a lot of suffering. So I feel compassion for my own suffering and compassion for the victims for losing their lives and compassion for the perpetrator who, through being a victim of a chain of causality that wired his brain the way it did through his genes and upbringing, inevitably pushed him into becoming a serial killer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not saying don&amp;rsquo;t be a &lt;em>good&lt;/em> person. If you really want the best for everyone, then feel free to promote goodness in the world. But if there are people you can&amp;rsquo;t empathize with, that you can&amp;rsquo;t relate to, then don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to. Maybe try talking to them to get their perspective. It is yet another form of doublethink to feel that you &lt;em>must&lt;/em> have compassion for all people. Entertain the idea that disliking people is okay. Maybe it is not a good guide to what you should do in regard to that person, but it&amp;rsquo;s important that you accept your dislike of them, and not force yourself to like them. It&amp;rsquo;s true that one can cultivate compassion for even someone who did horrible things like Ted Bundy or Hitler. But there is no &amp;ldquo;contest&amp;rdquo; of who can be the most compassionate person.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="being-nonjudgemental">Being Nonjudgemental&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is the idea that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge other people. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t judge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Love, not hate&amp;rdquo;. Being judgemental is seen as a bad thing. What I think this means more precisely is not to look down on other people for the way they are or their actions. But this is doublethink at its finest. Because in the command &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t judge&amp;rdquo;, there is an assumption that judging is not a good thing to do. So if you believe in not judging others, then you cannot judge the judgemental either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another reason this idea of not judging doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense is that you can&amp;rsquo;t not judge others. It&amp;rsquo;s not voluntary in any sense. It is not always appropriate to vocalize your judgement, but you cannot stop yourself from judging. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to point out someone like Kim Jong Un that everyone judges to be a bad human being. But you may meet someone with Tourette Syndrome and think to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Wow, their verbal tics are really annoying. Why can&amp;rsquo;t they shut up&amp;rdquo;? And next you think &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to feel that way. I know they can&amp;rsquo;t help it. What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with me&amp;rdquo;? This encapsulates the essence of doublethink. You feel like you&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;em>allowed&lt;/em> to find it annoying because the disabled can&amp;rsquo;t help it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-hand-story">First-Hand Story&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So far, this post has been very philosophical. So, I want to add in a personal story for concreteness. I once overheard a conversation between a student and a professor in his office. She was studying accounting. And she was absolutely struggling with it. She ended up audibly upset and crying about it. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to disappoint her parents by doing something else. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how far along she was in her degree, but that gave me the impression that she already invested some effort into it. She hated accounting, but felt like that&amp;rsquo;s what she had to do because of family pressure. This is a very common thing in my experience. Many students study &lt;em>just&lt;/em> to avoid disappointing family, their main motivation not really being to learn. In her case though, it seemed like she just didn&amp;rsquo;t like accounting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The professor gave her some really good advice. He told her that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be doing something she doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to do for decades. And that she should consider what she really wants, instead of what other people have told her she should do. She listened intently and took his advice. If I remember correctly she ended up changing majors, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know her personally so I&amp;rsquo;m not certain. That was some very solid advice he gave her though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="death">Death&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I have to add yet another important disclaimer. I worry that some readers could take this section the wrong way and I really don&amp;rsquo;t want that to happen. If you are suicidal, seek out professional help. I am not in any way condoning or encouraging suicide in this section. This is a purely philosophical discussion about the taboo of death. If someone you know has recently died or is dying, you might consider skipping ahead. If you are not mentally well or have depression, skip this section. It&amp;rsquo;s not worth the risk of reading into it something I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for the rest of this post to make sense. If you have any questions, feel free to &lt;a href="mailto:nicholasjohnson@posteo.org">email me&lt;/a>. With that out of the way, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Death is perhaps one of the greatest taboos in our modern society. It is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> something you bring up at the dinner table. People don&amp;rsquo;t like to be reminded that they won&amp;rsquo;t be here some day. There is a lot of anxiety around death. People generally avoid thinking about it. One benefit of believing in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or Hinduism is that you get an afterlife or a next life. You never really have to die. To me, living for eternity is more terrifying. After a trillion billion years, I think anyone would have had enough. People don&amp;rsquo;t consider how long forever really is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fear of death, I believe, is largely taught. Children learn to be afraid of it from their parents, teachers and peers. For example, everyone is supposed to act solemn and sad at funerals. The dead are underground, cremated, or burned. Out of sight and out of mind. As another example, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed people tend to have similar attitudes toward death as their parents and the prevailing culture. One thing that fascinates people about the joker character is that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t take anything seriously. He makes a mockery of even death itself. Ask yourself, why be afraid of death? What is there to fear? Maybe your family needs you. You are afraid of their grief. That&amp;rsquo;s fair. So then I ask, why be afraid of the fear of death? Fear is simply another sensation arising in the body. Are you afraid of the wind blowing against your skin? Then why be afraid of the feeling of fear? Why does it get a special status as opposed to any other feeling that passes by?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="wu-wei">Wu Wei&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Where am I going with all this? I want to invite every reader to consider something. What would happen if you simply let go of all expectations society has of you? What would happen if you gave no thought to what others think of you? What if you forgot about being a good person, loving and not hating, being happy and not sad? What would happen if you allowed yourself to feel whatever you feel, without judging it? What would happen if you allowed your thoughts, emotions, and sensations to come and go like clouds in the sky without trying to label them? Healthy or unhealthy, good or bad, acceptable or taboo?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-sky">The Sky&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The sky is simply the &lt;em>&lt;strong>space&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> in which the clouds appear and dissapate. The sky does not follow the clouds. The sky does not push the clouds away. The sky simply allows the clouds to come and go. Consciousness is where thoughts, emotions, and sensations appear and dissapate. The sensation of being identified with your thoughts, is itself a sensation arising in consciousness. From an experiential perspective, there is nowhere outside of consciousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might object: &amp;ldquo;You said earlier one cannot resist caring about what others think. So how can I be like the sky if I can&amp;rsquo;t stop judging my thoughts&amp;rdquo;? This is why they call it meditation &lt;em>practice&lt;/em>. Non-attachment takes practice. And mindfulness meditation is one of the most effective ways to achieve that state. It&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to let go, because you have been conditioned your whole life to be passionate and cling. If you can&amp;rsquo;t resist judging your thoughts, then judge them. Just don&amp;rsquo;t judge your judgements of your thoughts. Let your judgements of your thoughts pass like clouds in the sky. So on and so forth. With meditation, your mind will tire of thinking and judging everything all the time. You will become thoughtless. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t think when you need to. It means you won&amp;rsquo;t be held hostage by the next so called negative thought you have. You can see you true nature, prior to any idea about who society has told you you are supposed to be. It is a state of nonjudgemental, pure awareness. Some people report getting the feeling that their mind is in complete harmony with all that is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not a state of mind you can force. It&amp;rsquo;s a state of mind that comes about naturally as you practice meditation. It relates to the Chinese term &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">Wu Wei&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Non-action&amp;rdquo; can be seen as not acting upon the contents of consciousness, nor judging them. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you are completely isolated from society. To me, it means not being so involved in society that you lose who you are. Being in a state of mindlessness might sound contrary to intellectualism, but that&amp;rsquo;s a misunderstanding. The opposite is true. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to think when your mind &lt;em>isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> getting in the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Self</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-self/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-self/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="language">Language&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Starting at a young age, we pick up language, mainly from our parents. We are very much conditioned to think in certain ways by the language we speak. This is known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&lt;/a>. What I want to talk about is similar to Sapir-Whorf. It isn&amp;rsquo;t about how particular languages affect one&amp;rsquo;s worldview, but about how any language can create a false image of the world. Language is a tool for getting information from one mind to another. But it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. It is a tool for thinking. One thing that should be taught more in English classes is that writing is useful for crystallizing and refining thoughts, not just communicating them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with any spoken language is that in order to be useful, it has to create abstractions. These abstractions are fuzzy, inexact ways of talking about things. Mathematical language is not fuzzy and imprecise like spoken language is. Mathematical language is symbolic and rigorous. What is written is unambiguous. But this fuzziness of concept is a necessary evil, otherwise natural language would be inefficient and slow and still inexact. The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t language itself. It comes when we treat language as reality, when we forget we are dealing with these inexact fuzzy abstractions which are nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. A lot of the words in spoken language are fuzzy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is something that I have always found intuitive but is an easy mistake to make in philosophy. I would argue that a rather large fraction of academic papers about philosophy aren&amp;rsquo;t actually creating an interesting argument or bringing any substance to the table. Academics are simply bickering about how words should be used without even realizing it. For example, look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">the Ship of Theseus&lt;/a>. The essential question it poses is this: &amp;ldquo;Is an object the same object if all its component parts are replaced over time?&amp;rdquo;. I agree with Noam Chomsky that this is a cognitive issue manufactured by humans because we get really bent out of shape if we don&amp;rsquo;t know what to label something. We have to have a label. So what we do we call something if all its parts are replaced? Do we call it something else or do we call it the same thing? Now the problem becomes more clear. It&amp;rsquo;s a question about language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The right question is &amp;ldquo;If an object&amp;rsquo;s parts are replaced, should we still call it the same object?&amp;rdquo;. We could make a pros and cons list of calling it the same object versus giving it a different name and decide what makes more sense. One might think I&amp;rsquo;m being being pedantic about this and philosophers understand the real question is about what we call the object. My own personal experience has shown that this is not true. People often do not understand that they&amp;rsquo;re arguing about what to call something, and it&amp;rsquo;s not any deeper than that. This is called &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory">Mistaking the Map for the Territory&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we have also created another problem. What is an object? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a car for example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we haven&amp;rsquo;t replaced any parts. Where does the car stop and the car&amp;rsquo;s environment begin? Is the air inside the car also the car? What if the car is in orbit around the earth and it has no air, is the space inside the car still the car, or is it just empty space? This questioning is ridiculous in one sense because when I say the word &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo;, every English speaker intuitively knows what the word &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; means. For all practical usages of the word &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; we will never have to worry about bizarre philosophical quandries about the identity of the car (especially since there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;Car of Theseus&amp;rdquo;). We all just sort of know what other people talk about when they talk about a &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="opposites">Opposites&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Everything implies its opposite or negation. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this in a logical sense. I mean it as a matter of language. The word &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo; implies that there are words for other colors. It implies &amp;ldquo;not black&amp;rdquo; colors because otherwise we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need the word black. Left implies right. Up implies down. Forward implies backward. Here implies there. Car implies &amp;ldquo;not car&amp;rdquo; or environment for a better term. Just by using the word &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; we imply that there exists (in language, not literally exists in space) an environment which at least is defined as not being the car. The car is not its environment. This can be applied to any object. It also applies to adjectives and other features of language. Colorful implies colorless. Dumb implies smart. Yin-yang. It words for verbs as well. Running implies walking or crawling or not running. A pair of opposites that depend on one another. They cannot exist (conceptually) separately. So if they can&amp;rsquo;t exist separately, why call them opposites?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to see things from another point of view. What if instead of treating what we call a &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; as a separate idea from the environment of the car, we treat the car and the environment as one whole system. It could be called the &amp;ldquo;car-environment&amp;rdquo;. We are not accustomed to thinking of objects in these terms, primarily because we are conditioned to think using language that pretends that our distinction of what is a car and what is its environment is a real distinction made by the universe itself, not a somewhat arbitrary distinction as a product of evolved language. This is why we forget that voice in our head that we hear when reading this sentence is not us. So what about the word I? Where is the self that answers to the word &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, that is yourself?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-self">The Self&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a matter of language, the word &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; implies the word &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;. Other than self. Not self. Are you you&amp;rsquo;re brain? Where do the boundaries of &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; begin and end exactly? Where do &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; go when I sleep? The right question to ask is &amp;ldquo;What definition should the word I have?&amp;rdquo;. But we must remember that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is just a word, a concept. The concept of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is no more you than the concept of a &amp;ldquo;car&amp;rdquo; is an actual car. No matter how far you zoom in to a continuous function, you won&amp;rsquo;t see the discrete points that make it up. Eventually you get the idea of continuity. The self is similar. The more you zoom in to what you are calling &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, the less it makes sense to separate &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; from the rest of the cosmos. You are continuous with everything that is. You are one with the unfolding process that is this cosmos. You are not physically separate from it, despite the pesky word &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; that would have you think otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meditation is a practice that can help you experience this oneness, but it takes practice. Specifically, mindfulness meditation is a good place to start. Instead of &amp;ldquo;zooming in&amp;rdquo;, I often use the phrase &amp;ldquo;getting behind oneself&amp;rdquo;. For instance, you are reading this sentence and suddenly a thought pops into your head &amp;ldquo;What should I make for dinner tonight?&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s say the thought pops up exactly like that, in a bit of language. And then it passes and you keep reading. Where did that thought come from and where did it go? Did you generate that thought or did it just pop up? If you pay close enough attention, you can see how thoughts, moods, and sensations come and go without you &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; anything. One might call this level one of getting behind yourself. When you have an angry thought, you are no longer entranced by it. You are the self that notices the angry thought or the physiological change that comes with resurrecting that thought. You are no longer your thoughts. You are behind them, listening as a passive observer as if they are someone else&amp;rsquo;s thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting behind yourself a second time could mean that you notice the observer of your thoughts. To recap, level one is observing your thoughts and sensations. You are not behind your eyes, in your head as a matter of experience. You are the self that notices the feeling of having a head, the feeling of being behind your eyes, but you are not in your head behind your eyes. You are the noticer. Level two means that you notice the self that notices the feeling of having a head. What the ultimate goal here is, is trying to find the self that is doing the searching. You are trying to pay attention to your attention itself. I can call this level one and level two for clarity, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more of a continuous spectrum of awareness without clearly defined &amp;ldquo;levels&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about a dog chasing its own tail. Puppies might not realize that what they&amp;rsquo;re chasing is their own tail. But once they catch it and bite down, they know. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s better explained as a game of hide and go seek. You forget who you really are as you grow up. Others give you a name and assign adjectives to you as if that&amp;rsquo;s who you really are. You are told you are John, the clever thirty year old quirky accomplished artist and you better not think you&amp;rsquo;re anything else. To use the words of Alan Watts, you are an isolated ego inside a &amp;ldquo;bag of skin&amp;rdquo;. Life is like playing a game of hide and go seek where you are both the one hiding and the one seeking. And meditation is a technique for looking in the mirror and finding out the hider and seeker are the same person. Except the seeker goes by the name of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and the one hiding goes by the name of &amp;ldquo;the environment&amp;rdquo;. And when I say &amp;ldquo;the environment&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean just the physical environment. I mean the thoughts inside your head including the feeling of having a head.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conceptual-understanding-of-self-versus-experience">Conceptual Understanding of Self Versus Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you get what I&amp;rsquo;m saying about the self so far, that&amp;rsquo;s great. You have a conceptual understanding of it. But to only have a conceptual understanding is to miss the point. It&amp;rsquo;s like if a person were blind from birth. They can learn every fact there is to know about color. They can learn the cultural significance. For example, in American culture, blue means calmness and security. Black means darkness. Purple represents mystery. The blind person can learn the wavelengths that produce every color. They can know what colors go well together and what art styles are used with what color. But they have never actually seen color. So we would still say they lack perhaps the most important thing there is to know about color. The experience. The experience of color can&amp;rsquo;t be replaced by knowing facts about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An understanding of the self is precisely the same. You might understand everything you&amp;rsquo;ve read in this post so far, but you may have never looked within. This makes you like the blind man who knows all the facts about color, but has never seen it. Experiencing the loss of one&amp;rsquo;s ego can be described in words, but you&amp;rsquo;ll never get across in words the most important aspect, the experience, of the disillusionment one&amp;rsquo;s ego. It&amp;rsquo;s much richer to be the one that has seen color, experienced it, yet knows nothing about it than to be the blind person that knows every color fact. There are yogis and zen masters that are expert meditators but can&amp;rsquo;t articulate their experience outside of religious dogma. I think fewer are those that understand the self but don&amp;rsquo;t have some experience of it, because often accidental life experiences of self create the interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a growing interest in the west around meditation and self which has been understood in the east for over two and a half thousand years. This shows that it&amp;rsquo;s not a matter of knowing more facts. We have gained immense knowledge as a species over the past two and a half thousand years, but for most of us westerners we still have no clue about the self despite our technological advancement. It&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of looking within and regular practice meditating. Turns out there are some places more thinking can&amp;rsquo;t get you and the experience of oneness or &amp;ldquo;inner peace&amp;rdquo; is one of them. This I think is the hardest thing for a western person to digest because in almost every other area of human endeavor we can make progress by thinking. In meditation, the goal is to be thought-less, or at least aware of your thoughts. Awareness is a completely different mode than most of us westerners are used to using our brains. That&amp;rsquo;s another reason some struggle to wrap their mind around it. I can talk to some western people about the self and awareness and it&amp;rsquo;s as if they have no inner life whatsoever and don&amp;rsquo;t understand what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you take away anything from this post, understand that knowing facts about self versus experiencing it are orthogonal. If you want to really experience oneness with reality and get with your self, one way to do it is repeated meditation practice. There is no substitute. If you have any interest, just try it. Try different forms of meditation even for five or ten minutes, but start with mindfulness if you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner. And keep practicing even if you don&amp;rsquo;t notice anything the first few times. You really can&amp;rsquo;t fail because it&amp;rsquo;s like dancing. There is no end goal. You just do it for the sake of it. The most important thing is that you are doing it. Meditation doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee a profound experience, but I&amp;rsquo;d be surpised if I met someone who meditated properly for one week, an hour per day and found nothing of value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Victim Mentality Versus Individual Responsibility</title><link>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-victim-mentality-versus-individual-responsibility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0gitnick.xyz/the-victim-mentality-versus-individual-responsibility/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a compare and contrast of two seemingly opposing ideas. What I hope to show is that actually they are just two ways of talking about the same thing. I hope to find some common ground between left and right ideology. One is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;the victim mentality&amp;rdquo; and the other is what I call &amp;ldquo;individual responsiblity fetishism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-victim-mentality">The Victim Mentality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the United States, the extreme political left is seen as propping up this mindset. The victim mentality is when a person has the mentality that they are not &amp;ldquo;responsible&amp;rdquo; for anything that is happening or has happened to them. Said person feels completely and utterly a victim of circumstance. This can either take the form of collective victimhood or individual victimhood. In the individual case, a person may feel that they cannot succeed because some circumstance in their life prevents success. For example, a person may feel that they were not adequately educated in their poor high school and therefore that is preventing them from succeeding in college due to the catching up they have to do. So it is the &amp;ldquo;fault&amp;rdquo; of their high school or the teachers that taught at their high school. Their high school teachers may give the explanation that they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid enough and so their motivation is low, or they have so much else going on in life that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t properly focus on teaching, or that they were also educated poorly and their culture perpetuated bad memes which ultimately made them become a failure at their job. There are several problems with the idea of blame. As Jordan Peterson has pointed out, one problem with this mentality is that it invites an infinite regress. Everyone can blame their parents for how they are. And parents can blame grandparents and so on all the way back to Adam and Eve. I use &amp;ldquo;Adam and Eve&amp;rdquo; metaphorically. Of course Adam and Eve never actually existed and we know this because we know darwinian evolution occurred. But the point is that a regression of causes can be traced back to the very beginning, where we find whatever or whoever is ultimately responsible for all the evil mess in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the infinite temporal regression of blaming that can happen leaving no one and nothing ultimately responsible, there is also the possibility of the circularity of blame which also leaves no one ultimately responsible. Imagine a group of ten employees sitting at a round table meeting. The boss asks who is responsible for some financial mishap and everyone points to the person on their left, similar to how computer processes can enter a circular deadlock. Each process can blame the process it&amp;rsquo;s waiting on for being stuck, but the processes are waiting in a circular fashion preventing progress from being made. I like to see these two different scenarios of regression and circularity as part of &amp;ldquo;the blame game&amp;rdquo;, related to &amp;ldquo;playing the victim&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the victim card&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault, it&amp;rsquo;s someone else&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;m the victim here. I don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; anything. Things simply &amp;ldquo;happen&amp;rdquo; to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With collective victimhood, entire groups of people feel marginalized, mistreated, underrepresented, or discriminated against. Economic and social inequality and treatment of minorities are a focus of the left. Leftists are concerned about groups of people that are disadvantaged relative to others groups of people. Leftists might be apt to say that marginalized groups are not responsible for what happens to them. For example, black people were historically barred from voting. Black schools weren&amp;rsquo;t given the same resources as white schools. Segregation in public places instilled the idea that black and white people were meant to be separate and that black people were, rightly, second class citizens. It was pointed out that one problem with collective victimhood taken to the extreme is that it takes away all &amp;ldquo;agency&amp;rdquo; from the marginalized group. If a group is victimized, they have no responsiblity for where they are at and no agency to direct where they want to go. They are powerless. So one criticism of collective victimhood is that seeing yourself as a victim or in a group of victims is disempowering. It basically is saying that you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;direct your own destiny&amp;rdquo;. Your life is simply completely subject to &amp;ldquo;fate&amp;rdquo; as is everyone in your marginalized group. It is up to people not in the marginalized group, those with the agency, to fix things. Talking about agency starts to get into the idea of free will. Free will is an incoherent concept. I recommend Sam Harris' book &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/the-illusion-of-free-will/">The Illusion of Free Will&lt;/a> on the subject, although I plan on dedicating an entirely separate post to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, what we have to realize is that the victim mentality is a way of talking about events. To paint a clearer picture of what&amp;rsquo;s going on, I want to iterate through a few things. First, having a victim mentality can be disempowering to the person or group that has it. No doubt about that. It can create a feeling of helplessness, a sense of not having agency and control over your own life. I think that agency and control are complex subjects and loaded words, but I&amp;rsquo;m just talking about how the victim mentality can make people feel. It can create a feeling that the world or other people owe you something. It can be very devastating I think to the sense of control over your own life. If taken to the extreme, it can get you stuck in a place in life you don&amp;rsquo;t like, and you can keep yourself there for a long time by telling yourself there&amp;rsquo;s nothing you can do to improve your circumstances. And I do think this is a real thought pattern that drives self-pity and keeps people stuck in a bad situation. This is my primary concern with the victim mentality way of talking to yourself about things. And it is just a way of talking to yourself. That&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing to keep in mind, because blame is really an abstraction made up by people to figure out who we need to help or punish. You might say the abstraction of blame comes in useful sometimes to figure out who is responsible for some mistake so that person can be singled out and given whatever treatment they need so that the mistake doesn&amp;rsquo;t reoccur. But oftentimes, time is wasted figuring out who to blame. The desire to place blame can become so strong that you make up a sort of blame calculus and when all the tabulations are over, you realize the whole exercise was pointless. Because after the &amp;ldquo;blame units&amp;rdquo; have been tabulated and you know who to assign them to, the tabulation is functionally useless because despite the fact you know who to blame and how much, you did nothing with the tabulation. In that case, the abstraction of blame can become not so useful. A lot of time can be wasted playing the blame game to no useful end. That&amp;rsquo;s also something I see happen in the real world all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="individual-responsibility-fetishism">Individual Responsibility Fetishism&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the opposite side of the same coin propped up by extreme right. It involves talking to yourself as if you are a demigod. That is to say, you are directly personally responsible for everything in your life. It is just yet another way of talking to yourself, nothing more. The idea is, take &amp;ldquo;responsibility&amp;rdquo; for as much as you find it coherent to take responsibility for. Obviously, the weather affects your life. But, I don&amp;rsquo;t think even the most extreme right wing &amp;ldquo;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&amp;rdquo; personality would argue that you are responsible for the weather. Although they might argue that you are responsible for how the weather makes you feel or how you are affected by the rain because you could bring an umbrella. When people talk to themselves in this way, they don&amp;rsquo;t tend to make themselves responsible for every single event that happens, just as much as it makes sense to. Interestingly, this individual responsibility fetishism occasionally shadows other people&amp;rsquo;s responsibility. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this mindset among members of the military. It is my fault, not the person under my supervision. It&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of the victim mentality. I&amp;rsquo;m at &amp;ldquo;fault&amp;rdquo; for the failure of anyone I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of. It&amp;rsquo;s my failure, not theirs. I obviously failed to adequately train them, so blame me, not them for their failure to perform. In other words, bear the greatest burden you can bear and no more than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that many people who have this mindset and believe it firmly are competent and successful people and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why this kind of mindset would correlate with success. Talking to yourself this way can be very useful. I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for my own happiness. I&amp;rsquo;m not the victim. I am oppressed by my genes, childhood, past bullying, bad habits, or whatever, but it is my responsibility now to overcome those things. I &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; almost everything. Things don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;happen to me&amp;rdquo;. I take ownership over what happens in my life because the results of my life are my own doing. Motivational videos often talk to people this way. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if there is any truth to it or if the abstraction of individual responsiblity makes sense given the lack of free will. For people with this mentality, they just recognize it&amp;rsquo;s a useful way to talk to themselves inside their head because it has helped them succeed personally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One issue with this abstraction of individual responsibility and this mindset is that it can be hard to draw a line between what you do and what happens to you. As a concrete example, you feel that you are reading this sentence right now. But are you beating your heart? The fact that the phrase &amp;ldquo;I beat my heart&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in English indicates that people feel the beating of their heart isn&amp;rsquo;t something they do. It is something that happens on its own. We say, &amp;ldquo;my heart beats&amp;rdquo;. With breathing, you can say to someone &amp;ldquo;you are now manually breathing&amp;rdquo; and they will become aware of their breath. They will go from feeling as if breathing is just happening, to feeling that they are now consciously doing the breathing. This is why the breath is often used as an object of meditation. You can feel as if you are doing it or as if it is happening all on its own. Back to individual responsibility. Where should one draw this distinction between what you do and what happens to you? You have billions of cells in your body that operate, but you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you are doing that. That is something that is happening. Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to take the attitude that you&amp;rsquo;re responsible in your life, you better be able to say what the difference is between what happens to you and what you are doing. And there seems to be no hard and fast rule to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Individual responsibility in the popular conception depends on other abstractions. It depends on free will which is incoherent. This is easy to see because there is an infinite regress of prior causes that lead up to this moment for which you couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had any control by definition. As Sam Harris puts it, &amp;ldquo;the buck has to stop somewhere&amp;rdquo;. There is also the abstraction of self and other. This is a big topic worthy of its own post. But in short, where do you draw the boundaries between what is you and what is not you? Are you your brain? Surely not. You aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of plenty of things your brain is doing such processing your visual field (unless you&amp;rsquo;re looking at an optical illusion) or interpreting words you&amp;rsquo;re reading right now or muscle memory. That happens without you thinking about it, automatically. You don&amp;rsquo;t feel you are doing it. So if you are aware of your brain, does that mean you are just a passenger, a silent observer? If so, how can you be personally responsible for anything? There is also the whole issue of separate events. What is an event? When does an event start and end? If we are going to be responsible for an event that we caused, then we need to be able to define when that event started and when it ended and what it was that was contained in that event. Or we could define everything as just one happening. We can play the game of not talking about causes and effects, but just one singular happening that is the whole cosmos. That&amp;rsquo;s another way of talking about the world that makes one wonder where individual responsibility could fit in. How can you be responsible if the universe is described as a singular going on and not separate events which you could individually claim responsibility for? If we&amp;rsquo;re going to play this game of talking about responsibility, it might be trickier than we thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see several dangers of the total individual responsibility way of viewing the world. By far the most common danger I see is the downplaying or complete disregard for societal, systemic issues. I met a member of the military that was willing to take responsibility for the mistakes of others he was in charge of. He felt his responsibility extended to others in that case. But when it came to the poor, he completely changed his tune. The poor were completely responsible for where they were at. He believed there was absolutely nothing society could do to help them and we all might as well not try. They&amp;rsquo;ll just have to pick themselves up by their bootstraps on their own. One could have said the same thing about black people during the civil rights era. If they want rights, they will just have to fight for them on their own. I have no responsibility to help them do that. That&amp;rsquo;s their individual responsibility, not mine. This is absurd. Surely, as a society we can agree that even if you want to view things with the &amp;ldquo;total individual responsibility&amp;rdquo; lense there are still actions others can take and policies that can be written into law that make the probability of success greater for everyone looking at society as a whole system. You can still play the game of seeing things through the &amp;ldquo;total individual responsibility&amp;rdquo; lense while admitting that society has systemic issues that no one individual can solve. These are not actually opposing sides. Doing things like making college tuition free, providing healthcare to all citizens, and ending the war on drugs would make it easier for individuals to take responsibility in their lives. As it turns out, if you take those undue burdens off people, they will find it easier to improve their lives and take responsibility, not get lazy and complacent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So what am I really getting at with all this? These two ways of talking to yourself have their respective benefits and pitfalls. If you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re in control, you can make a fetish out of individual responsibility and go around telling people they control their own destiny and it&amp;rsquo;s all up to them and all they have to do is try. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you can go around saying everyone is powerless and there is nothing they can do to change the way their life is. But I want to make the point that the confusion really does come along from the way we talk to ourselves about things and the abstractions we build. This is obvious because as a matter of physics, there is no confusion about what is going on in the universe, physically. It is our language that gets us all mixed up, not the goings-on of the universe. But with our limited human brains we need abstractions to simplify the goings-on. We need approximations. I am not advocating we get rid of the idea of individual responsibility or victimization. It may be useful to refine the ideas or replace them with better abstractions or reinterpret them. In software development, there is a saying about abstractions. All abstractions are leaky. We make abstractions and then rely on their infallibility. But abstractions aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect representations of what they&amp;rsquo;re abstracting, or else they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be called abstractions. What that means is we need to recognize when our abstractions begin to break down and where they don&amp;rsquo;t apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the risk of oversimplifying, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do us any good to play the blame game so much so that we end up feeling like we have no power to create change in our lives and the lives of others. We end up disempowering ourselves that way and wasting mental energy feeling sorry for ourselves. Everyone reading this has probably met someone that has done that at some point in our lives. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to fetishize individual responsibility to the point where we become callous and blind to systemic injustice and inequality or insist that existing social hierarchy is inevitable. This is the mistake that PragerU and Jordan Peterson make in my view.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
