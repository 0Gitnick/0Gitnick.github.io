I have a few comments to make. Smith cites processor-intensive video rendering as a reason you might need a newer computer. There&rsquo;s also training/running neural networks, mining digital currency and some exhaustive search algorithms. But again the average person won&rsquo;t be doing those things.</p><h2 id=intel-management-engine>Intel Management Engine</h2><p>Smith also claims the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME), the hidden processor in every modern Intel chip, is a government backdoor. This isn&rsquo;t yet proven but the code in Intel ME is proprietary and secret, so it should be treated as a <em>potential</em> intentional backdoor. <em>At minimum</em> it&rsquo;s a <a href=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it>security hazard</a>. Smith notes that AMD processors have basically the same problem.</p><p>The potential backdoor is really the crux of the ethical problem. Even if you don&rsquo;t care about the price and you never drop your computer and you never replace any parts there&rsquo;s still the potential backdoor. <strong>Intel ME is always on even when your computer is turned off. It can&rsquo;t be removed. No one knows what it actually does and Intel won&rsquo;t tell us. We know it has full control over system memory and it can connect to the internet.</strong> If you&rsquo;re at all tempted to use the <a href=https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide>nothing to hide argument</a> I only ask that you apply that same logic to Intel. If Intel has nothing to hide, why can&rsquo;t they show us the source code for the ME? Why keep it secret? Why not allay all fears of a backdoor once and for all by releasing the source code? Unless of course it is in fact a backdoor.</p><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re above nothing to hide though. You understand privacy is a human right. But, you reason, the Intel ME isn&rsquo;t a big deal because an interested government could find out what they wanted to know some other way. Besides even without ME there&rsquo;s other embedded software that, however unlikely it is, could possibly also have backdoors. All that&rsquo;s beyond your &ldquo;threat model&rdquo; anyway. This goes back to a previous post I made. By using the <em>least</em> potentially backdoored computer possible, you <a href=../raising-the-bar-on-privacy>raise the bar on privacy</a> (and freedom!). That&rsquo;s a cause we <em>all</em> need to be fighting for irrespective of threat models.</p><h2 id=retrofreedom>RetroFreedom</h2><p>The next most obvious question is &ldquo;Where do I buy a computer without a backdoor?&rdquo;. I recommend <a href=https://retrofreedom.com/>RetroFreedom</a> (formerly Minifree). <a href=https://vimuser.org/>Leah Rowe</a> operates the site. She maintains the <a href=https://libreboot.org/>Libreboot</a> project, a free as in freedom alternative BIOS that ships with the old Thinkpads she sells. You can purchase products with cryptocurrency and several addons and upgrades are offered. I don&rsquo;t mind the markup in price since I know it goes toward an important free software project. I can personally attest to the quality of the laptops from RetroFreedom. I&rsquo;ve bought several laptops from there running exclusively free software and I&rsquo;m very satisfied.</p><h2 id=free-software>Free Software</h2><p>I would never again use a nonfree laptop to do my everyday personal computing. I&rsquo;ve given up videogames since all the popular titles are nonfree requiring me to run the Winblows operating system. <a href=../why-i-left-its>I quit my job</a> to avoid promoting proprietary software. <a href=../the-tipping-point-rejecting-windows-zoom-lockdown-browser-and-the-lockdown-monitor>I dropped out of college</a> so I didn&rsquo;t have to use invasive proprietary malware. Too many people have told me I&rsquo;m too extreme. I care too much about free software. Life is just too short to be so picky. But to them I would say this:</p><p>What does it say about society that the only way to get a non-backdoored laptop is to buy from a specific set of computers that are around 13 years old, replace the WiFi card, use special equipment to flash the BIOS with Libreboot/Coreboot and replace the operating system with GNU/Linux? Or pay someone else to do the procedure.</p><p>Further, what you have to realize is there is a war being waged on general-purpose computing. Every year manufacturers come up with new ways to make your computer harder to repair thereby increasing e-waste. Every year software companies make their ecosystems more locked down giving you less and less control over your own devices. To <em>not</em> use an old Thinkpad is to be on the wrong side of this war. <strong>I do not want to live in a world where I don&rsquo;t have control over what I buy and cannot repair it</strong>.</p><p><strong>Most people living in 1st world countries today are far too complacent</strong>. I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough. So when people ask me why I care so much, why I&rsquo;ve given up <em>so</em> much, I look at them in bewilderment. Why <em>don&rsquo;t</em> they? If people like them don&rsquo;t start caring soon we&rsquo;re going to live in a dark world where computer users are totally subjugated. The 13 year old Thinkpads suffice for 95% of use cases for now but that won&rsquo;t always be true. Proprietary threats are looming. Change needs to happen now, not 10 years from now. So use a free laptop even if it&rsquo;s inconvenient because it&rsquo;s not getting any easier.</p><h2 id=privacy>Privacy</h2><p>There&rsquo;s also the whole privacy issue of having a potentially backdoored laptop. A college professor once told me privacy is dead. As if it were just a fact of the modern era and I hadn&rsquo;t realized it yet. As long as there are people like me are around privacy is <em>not</em> dead. I will <em>never</em> accept a world without privacy. I will resist backdoors into my computer. I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing. It wasn&rsquo;t all the free software people that inspired this in me. It was the haters. Those who said it didn&rsquo;t matter, privacy is dead, it&rsquo;s unwinnable, I should just give up so my life is easier, etc. So please tell me any of those things. The naysayers keep me motivated. I don&rsquo;t waste my time wondering whether free software is a fight we can win. It&rsquo;s a fight we <em>must</em> win. As long as there&rsquo;s <em>any</em> chance of winning, and even if it <em>seems like</em> there&rsquo;s not, we <em>must</em> try.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to quit your job and drop out to create change. All you have to do is create a rift. Get people to take notice. Force them to act by being unmoving in your commitment to free software. You won&rsquo;t be popular. And you&rsquo;ll be told you&rsquo;re wrong <em>a lot</em>. You might even start to doubt yourself. But let others say whatever they want and stay strong anyway. You have an advantage they don&rsquo;t: the knowledge that you&rsquo;re doing the right thing. You do have power. Those in power would like you to think that you don&rsquo;t, but you do. Wield it wisely.</p></div></article></div><aside class="col-12 col-md-3 float-left sidebar"><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-pages"><h3>Pages</h3><ul><li><a href=../>Home</a></li><li><a href=../about/>About</a></li><li><a href=../index.xml>RSS</a></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-links"><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href=../pub_key.asc><span>PGP</span></a></li><li><a href=mailto:nicholasjohnson@posteo.org><span>Email</span></a></li><li><a href=https://git.0gitnick.xyz/0gitnick><span>Code</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mirrors.0gitnick.xyz><span>Mirrors</span></a></li><li><a href=https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/0B4E3C54AF4566E96666728B8FFD1B6B4CB568DF><span>Tor Relay</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-tags"><h3>Tags</h3><div><span><a href=../tags/articles/>articles</a></span>
