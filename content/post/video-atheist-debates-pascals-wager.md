[Matt Dillahunty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillahunty) thoroughly refutes Pascal's Wager.<!--more--> He mentions the idea of [fractal wrongness](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fractal_wrongness) which means that a worldview is wrong at every scale of resolution. Many theistic arguments are fractally wrong, not just Pascal's Wager. But I'm really glad Matt brings it up in this video.
