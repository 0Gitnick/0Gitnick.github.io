## What's New
I changed the website theme. It's darker now and much easier on the eyes. I didn't particularly like the last theme ever since I started using it. I only picked it because it was easy to manage with how minimal it was. I added a favicon to identify my site:

![favicon](/favicon.ico)

It's nothing to brag about. I just thought I ought to have _something_ there. The markdown is improved, especially the blockquotes. It didn't seem like they were rendering on the previous theme, but now they do. Each post now has a word count and estimated reading time in the metadata section. Posts are paginated so they're not all on one page like before. I'm allergic to client-side JS, so this site has none. I modified the theme to use CSS rather than JS for the interactive features. I'm happy with the way it turned out and I consider it a significant improvement. The new theme is everything I originally wanted for my blog, so it's here to stay.
