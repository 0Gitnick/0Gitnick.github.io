## Matrix
The only gripe I have about the video is the same one I had in [Fixing Social Media for Good](/video-fixing-social-media-for-good). While [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_%28information_technology%29) and infinitely better than Whatsapp, federation still tends toward centralization. Also Matrix _doesn't_ protect metadata either and as TheHatedOne mentions, leaking metadata is really bad for a communications platform even if data is protected.

## Signal
[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) says it protects metadata, but there's no way for users to verify that besides taking Signal's word for it _and_ Signal is centralized. So neither Signal nor Matrix are the _final_ solution to secure communications.

## Cwtch
[Peer to peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) is the best solution because there's no way for it to tend towards centralization. Once [cwtch.im](https://cwtch.im/) (Cwtch is Welsh for hug/cuddle) is stable it will probably be the best peer to peer instant messaging solution since it can _verifiably_ protect metadata and have encrypted group conversations. It's also built on [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29) which is the most tested, most researched and most used anonymity network out there.
