In his [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast) podcast [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org) talks about why Donald Trump is unfit for public office. For reference, these clips come from Making Sense episodes [#38](https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-end-of-faith-sessions-2/) and #45. They were recorded before the 2016 presidential election but the past 4 years have only shown how right Harris was in his judgement of Trump.<!--more--> I haven't seen anyone else speak with the same clarity and completeness about Trump as Harris, so that's why I picked these clips.

I had a very similar if not the same opinion of Trump 4 years ago. I immediately recognized him as a narcissistic unintelligent con man unfit for public office. If I had expressed my opinion at the time in writing it probably would have sounded much like these clips from the Making Sense podcast. Although much has happened since 2016, I still find these clips worth sharing.
