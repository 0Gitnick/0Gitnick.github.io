This is my second book recommendation and here I am _again_ recommending a book authored by [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org). And it's probably not the last time I'll recommend his books. Allow me to justify why his content gets so much promotion on this blog.

## Why I Promote Sam Harris Content
When someone holds a false belief, especially if it's a core belief, they are likely to accept other concomitant falsehoods. This is why you don't hear about theoretical physicist flat earthers. Being a theoretical physicist entails beliefs about the physical universe which are _incompatible_ with believing the earth is flat. To knowingly hold contradictory beliefs, the phenomenon known as [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), is psychologically distressing. So people make some effort, however minimal, to reconcile their beliefs to create a consistent picture of reality.

The converse is also true. When someone holds true core beliefs, they're usually right about concomitant truths as well. I'm vastly oversimplifying and I could mention many caveats but that's generally the case. On several subject areas of my interest Sam Harris _consistently_ gets it right. He's adept at navigating the pitfalls others find themselves trapped in when talking about spirituality. Sometimes I learn completely new information from him but I also find that he often expounds on my own thoughts better than I can. I hope I will eventually be as articulate on this blog as he is in his writing. Nonetheless I don't agree with him about everything and I also don't desire for my own voice to be identical to his.

## Waking Up
When it comes to introducing spirituality to atheists and skeptics, Waking Up is _the_ book to read. I've read it and reread it and I couldn't find _any_ unsupported claims. It's expressive, relevant and intelligible to sincere truthseekers. Waking Up elaborates on the self in a clearer, more comprehensible way than [my own](/the-self) [past attempts](/ego-traps). It mentions the idea of headlessness which [I've also talked about before](/the-eternal-here-and-now). So before you read anything from other popular spiritual authors, I'd recommend reading Waking Up first. It gives the broader context that other books on spirituality leave out.

Waking Up is a refreshing, rational middleground on spirituality avoiding both [denial of spiritual experiences](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Spirituality) by skeptics _and_ mystical [woo-woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Woo) peddled by [Deepak Chopra](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra) and other pseudointellectuals. I recommend it to anyone remotely interested in spirituality.

To finish off this post, I'll leave you with a quote from the book.

> "Until we can talk about spirituality in rational terms—acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence—our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. This book has been my attempt to begin such a conversation." -- Sam Harris in Waking Up
