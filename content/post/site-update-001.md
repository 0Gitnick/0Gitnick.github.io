### What's New
I just finished migrating this site to a new server in Poland and I made a few changes along the way. I added __IPv6 support__ to the site. I cleaned up the [about](/about) page and added some context to give the site a clear purpose. The primary crypto donation method is now Monero instead of Bitcoin. It's better for privacy. I also switched from Ko-fi to [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com). Liberapay supports multiple currencies and languages. It's a non-profit that handles transactions transparently with [free software](https://github.com/liberapay).    

As for the site mirrors, I removed the [SIUe](https://www.siue.edu/~njohnag) mirror since it's insecure and I seem to have lost access since I don't attend any more. I changed the onion address to a new [vanity onion](http://gitnickkff6dtksy4txvwmgibwa3x5syfcyzk6kjnisuknuutwtumdid.onion). I also registered my [I2P site](http://0gitnick.i2p) with zzz's I2P domain name service so it's more memorable. It will take up to a week to propogate through all the nodes, so you'll have to use the direct [base32 address](http://xpw6ynhbxxuqsr6spcnfiyvuhvimm3jg7uti2oqv3jlh76j532oa.b32.i2p) or a [jump service](http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/jump.cgi?a=0gitnick.i2p) to access this blog over I2P for now. I don't plan on changing the links again so __it's safe to bookmark the new onion address and I2P link.__ I've made a backup of the private keys for the eepsite, onion, and zeronet addresses. In the event of a future server migration, I'll be able to keep the addresses the same.
