## What's New
It seems I'm making update posts more often than I imagined, but it's fine. I'm going to try out a list format for this one.

* Change "recommendation" tag to more specific tags. (e.g., "books", "videos")
* Sign commits on [Github](https://github.com/0Gitnick/0Gitnick.github.io)/[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/0Gitnick/0Gitnick.github.io) so users can [TOFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use) this blog
* Minify html and css

## Future Plans
* Mirror site repo and scripts on [Savannah](https://savannah.nongnu.org/users/gitnick)
* Write [content summaries](https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/) for each post for improved site/RSS readability
* Reconsider posts displayed per page after adjusting site summaries
