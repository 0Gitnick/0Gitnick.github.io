title: "SIUe Cyberstalking Feature"
date: 2020-06-06
tags: ["privacy", "SIUe"]
summary: "Every SIUe student, faculty and staff member's full name, year, address and phone number has been available through the university [search engine](https://www.siue.edu/search/people.shtml) for _years_. It could facilitate stalking and it's a _huge_ data privacy concern. It should _at least_ be behind a login portal and remove phone numbers and addresses."

This lesser-known feature has existed for at least 2 years and probably much longer than that. I emailed their [helpdesk](mailto:help@siue.edu) several times pointing out the search feature could be abused by cyberstalkers and data mined. I pointed out that it should require authentication and not be open to the public internet. It's a huge risk for student privacy and safety. Anyone can find any student's full name, area of study, rank, home address, phone number and university email. A week later, I still have no response.    

A quick search reveals that other university's student directories generally don't include the student's rank, home address, or phone number. SIUe should at least remove the home address and phone number fields from public view.
